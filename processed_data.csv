The professional development of medical social workers currently faces several dilemmas，such as insufficient professionalism，unbroken professional barriers，and an incomplete policy system. To address these dilemmas，medical social workers should clarify the dimensions of their professional capabilities and strive to improve their professional capabilities，building a professional capability framework focusing on problem-solving. Meanwhile，with the popularization of AI technology，the cross-field integration and development of “AI + medical social workers”have brought new opportunities for the professional capability construction of medical social workers. For example，big data can enhance the optimization of electronic health record services；virtual reality（VR）and augmented reality can facilitate the electronic standardization of social worker training for clients；and machine learning can promote the transformation of the social work service model towards“risk prediction and advance intervention，”assisting in improving direct service capabilities.

"Within the United States, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. There are well-established inequities in cardiovascular care; individuals from medically underserved populations—including those with low socioeconomic status, rural populations, a plethora of racial and ethnic groups, women, and those living with disabilities—are often at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite their critically unmet needs, these populations remain underrepresented within cardiovascular clinical trials, therefore deepening inequities in cardiovascular care. The inclusion of representative populations within cardiovascular clinical research ensures that data derived from clinical trials translate into effectiveness for all populations, particularly as cardiovascular therapeutics move toward personalized approaches. In this article, we review the importance of including underserved populations in cardiovascular clinical research and the key barriers to their participation. We explore system-level strategies that have only recently demonstrated large-scale feasibility within the cardiovascular research paradigm, such as community-engaged research and clinical trial decentralization, to increase",Improving Representation of Underserved Populations in Cardiovascular Research,electronic health records,Article,,within united state cardiovascular disease leading cause death well established inequity cardiovascular care individual medically underserved population including low socioeconomic status rural population plethora racial ethnic group woman living disability often increased risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality despite critically unmet need population remain underrepresented within cardiovascular clinical trial therefore deepening inequity cardiovascular care inclusion representative population within cardiovascular clinical research ensures data derived clinical trial translate effectiveness population particularly cardiovascular therapeutic move toward personalized approach article review importance including underserved population cardiovascular clinical research key barrier participation explore system level strategy recently demonstrated large scale feasibility within cardiovascular research paradigm community engaged research clinical trial decentralization increase
"Introduction: The rapid adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems has resulted in extensive archives of data relevant to clinical research, hospital operations, and the development of learning health systems. However, EHR data are not frequently available, cleaned, standardized, validated, and ready for use by stakeholders. We describe an in-progress effort to overcome these challenges with cooperative, systematic data extraction and validation. Methods: A multi-disciplinary team of investigators collaborated to create the Complete Inpatient Record Using Comprehensive Electronic Data (CIRCE) Project dataset, which captures EHR data from six hospitals within the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Analysts and clinical researchers jointly iteratively reviewed SQL queries and their output to validate desired data elements. Data from patients aged ≥18 years with at least one encounter at an acute care hospital or hospice occurring since 7/1/2017 were included.

"The healthcare industry is at significant risk of cybercrime and privacy violations due to the extensive distribution and sensitivity of health data. Recent trends in confidentiality breaches across multiple industries highlight the critical need for improved data security technologies that ensure privacy, accuracy, and reliability. Furthermore, decentralized healthcare systems suffer from intermittent remote clients and imbalanced data. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning (P2FL) approach for improving medical data privacy in health care informatics on edge devices. The remote clients in FL may have imbalanced datasets for local training, leading to lower results. Data augmentation procedures are employed in local model training to address this issue and balance datasets. Dynamic customer interactions with the global server via remote healthcare facilities are challenging. In real-world scenarios, technical or connectivity issues may cause clients to attend or exit the training session. The proposed methodology is tested on various clients and image",P2FL: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Approach for Healthcare Informatics at the Edge,electronic health records,Book chapter,,healthcare industry significant risk cybercrime privacy violation due extensive distribution sensitivity health data recent trend confidentiality breach across multiple industry highlight critical need improved data security technology ensure privacy accuracy reliability furthermore decentralized healthcare system suffer intermittent remote client imbalanced data paper proposes privacy preserving federated learning fl approach improving medical data privacy health care informatics edge device remote client fl may imbalanced datasets local training leading lower result data augmentation procedure employed local model training address issue balance datasets dynamic customer interaction global server via remote healthcare facility challenging real world scenario technical connectivity issue may cause client attend exit training session proposed methodology tested various client image
"Accurate and timely diagnoses are essential in emergency medicine, where delays in care can have severe consequences. The goal of the study was to use the MIMIC-III dataset to evaluate ClinicalBERT and GPT-4 models in predicting discharge diagnoses using inpatient notes. In GPT-4 diagnostic prediction, we investigated two prompt engineering methods: the binary voting method and the scaled likelihood rating method. We tested four conditions: circulatory system diseases, respiratory diseases, septicemia, and pneumonia, with 160 cases analyzed. ClinicalBERT outperformed GPT models, achieving the highest F1 scores across all categories. It scored 0.816 for circulatory diseases, 0.952 for respiratory diseases, 0.889 for septicemia, and 0.743 for pneumonia. The GPT binary voting method performed slightly better than the scaled likelihood rating method in most cases. While ClinicalBERT required significant computational resources, GPT-4 needed no pre-training, had high recall but lower precision, and could process longer text. © 2025 The Authors.

"Objectives: To document the proportion of transgender and gender diverse (TGD) youth presenting to a pediatric psychiatric emergency department (ED) and examine whether their demographic and clinical characteristics differ from cisgender youth. Methods: We analyzed electronic health records of youth ages 5 to 17 years presenting to a specialized pediatric psychiatric ED (N = 2728), including sociodemographic characteristics, gender identity, suicidal risk at admission, and diagnoses at discharge. We examined differences by gender identity using χ2 tests (categorical variables), 2-sample t tests, or Mann-Whitney U tests (continuous variables). Adjusted Poisson regression models estimated the prevalence ratio of the association between gender identity and clinical diagnoses. Results: Of youth, 6% seeking emergency psychiatric care identified as TGD. Compared with cisgender peers, TGD youth exhibited a higher risk for suicide, longer hospital stays, and received more psychiatric diagnoses at discharge, including a higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (prevalence ratio: 1.50,",Psychiatric Emergency Service Use by Transgender and Gender-Diverse Youth,electronic health records,Article,,objective document proportion transgender gender diverse tgd youth presenting pediatric psychiatric emergency department ed examine whether demographic clinical characteristic differ cisgender youth method analyzed electronic health record youth age year presenting specialized pediatric psychiatric ed including sociodemographic characteristic gender identity suicidal risk admission diagnosis discharge examined difference gender identity using test categorical variable sample test mann whitney test continuous variable adjusted poisson regression model estimated prevalence ratio association gender identity clinical diagnosis result youth seeking emergency psychiatric care identified tgd compared cisgender peer tgd youth exhibited higher risk suicide longer hospital stay received psychiatric diagnosis discharge including higher prevalence suicidal thought behavior prevalence ratio
"Drug recommendation uses AI technology to combine a patient's electronic health records with medical knowledge to help doctors recommend safer and more accurate drug combinations. Time-dependence of patients’ historical records plays a crucial role in existing methods, but some of them ignore or disregard the explainability of the recommendation, and some recommendation results are accompanied by high drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Therefore, an explainable drug recommendation model(ExpDrug) with low DDIs is proposed in this article. It maps the ”black-box” features of patient diagnoses, procedures and medications to the explainable aspect features, and minimizes both rating prediction loss and explainable loss to improve recommendation performance. In addition, a controllable threshold strategy is proposed to reduce the DDI rate. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MIMIC-III dataset, and the proposed ExpDrug achieves new state-of-the-art performance across safety, explainability and four accuracy metrics.

"Informal carers-those who provide unpaid care for people with health concerns or age-related needs- frequently experience negative impacts on their own physical, mental, and social wellbeing. Health systems should respond to these impacts by explicitly recognising and addressing the support needs of informal carers. Positive outcomes for this underserved population group, sustain delivery of care, and reduce further burden on the healthcare system. Three changes are needed to improve how health systems support carers. First, there must be a stronger and more systematic focus on carers’ wellbeing, including through the expansion of patient-centered care models to explicitly include carers. This should involve co-designing healthcare systems in ways that create space for carers as active partners in care. Second, carers’ needs should be routinely identified and assessed in clinical practice using standardised tools, ideally integrated into electronic health records. Third, clinicians must be supported to provide care for carers when needed—this",We should care about informal carers: Reforms are needed to improve their health and wellbeing,electronic health records,Article,,informal carers provide unpaid care people health concern age related need frequently experience negative impact physical mental social wellbeing health system respond impact explicitly recognising addressing support need informal carers positive outcome underserved population group sustain delivery care reduce burden healthcare system three change needed improve health system support carers first must stronger systematic focus carers wellbeing including expansion patient centered care model explicitly include carers involve co designing healthcare system way create space carers active partner care second carers need routinely identified assessed clinical practice using standardised tool ideally integrated electronic health record third clinician must supported provide care carers needed
"Objectives: To explore the view of nonlayperson committee members on the added value of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) instrument to measure patient and committee member preferences for a health intervention. Methods: Nine semistructured interviews were conducted with voting members from two types of advisory committees in Quebec, Canada: one from the Ministry of Health and Social Services, and eight from the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agency. The DCE instrument, administrable to patients (i.e., pregnant women) and committee members, was developed and administered to both groups to measure their preferences about the addition of fetal chromosomal anomalies to a prenatal screening program. A conceptual framework consisting of three dimensions (relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity) was used for data collection and analyses. Results: Committee members considered the DCE instrument, when used with both patients and committee members, to be particularly valuable in raising awareness of potential biases.

"Background: Anomalies in healthcare refer to deviation from the norm of unusual or unexpected patterns or activities related to patients, diseases or medical centres. Detecting these anomalies is crucial for timely interventions and efficient decision-making, helping to identify issues like operational inefficiencies, fraud and emerging health complications. Objectives: This study presents a novel method for detecting both collective and individual anomalies in healthcare data through time series analysis using unsupervised machine learning. The dual-strategy approach leverages two methodologies: a ’practice centre-based approach’ which monitors changes across different practice centres and a ’process-based approach’ which focuses on identifying anomalies within individual centres. The former allows for early detection of systemic issues, while the latter highlights specific irregularities within a centre's operations. Methods: The study utilised a dataset over 500,000 medical records from multiple GP practice centres in the UK collected between 2018–2023.

"Secure data transmission is critical to cloud-based electronic healthcare (e-healthcare) systems. Upon delving into the literature, it becomes clear that several security mechanisms have been developed to ensure the security of exchanged information across patients, physicians, and the cloud server, but they do not resist vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle, side-channel, and session key hijacking attacks. These vulnerabilities can seriously compromise the integrity of exchanged medical records. In light of this, the article proposes a cloud-assisted key agreement protocol for the e-healthcare system to enable secure authentication for patient monitoring, enhancing mutual authentication of the participating entities and creating protected session keys for secure open-channel communication. The proposed methodology employs robust and lightweight procedures, including SHA-256 and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), while considering the challenges of implementing strong security protocols in healthcare systems, such as the need for high performance and low energy consumption.

"Digital transformation of healthcare has led to widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), significantly enhancing the accessibility and efficiency of clinical workflows, administrative processes and biomedical research. Given the highly sensitive nature of patient data, ensuring its confidentiality, integrity and controlled access is paramount. However, conventional EHR systems predominantly rely on centralized storage architectures, which are vulnerable to unauthorized access, data breaches and insider threats, posing severe privacy and security concerns. To address these challenges, blockchain technology offers a promising decentralized infrastructure characterized by immutability, transparency and distributed trust. By integrating smart contracts and secure transaction logging, blockchain strengthens data provenance and enforces auditable access control in healthcare systems. Complementing this, encryption techniques are essential for maintaining confidentiality; however, traditional key generation and management approaches often lack adaptability and entropy, limiting their robustness in dynamic threat landscapes.

"Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are designed to enhance patient safety by providing alerts to prescribers about potential medication issues. However, a significant proportion of these alerts are ignored, which can compromise patient safety. This study explores the feasibility of using subgroup discovery, a machine learning method, to identify determinants influencing physicians’ medication-related CDSS alert handling. By analyzing CDSS log data from the electronic health record, this research shows the feasibility of the use of subgroup discovery on this data, and its potential to uncover behavioral patterns and factors that affect how alerts are managed. This can ultimately contribute to the design of more effective CDSS alerts and improving patient safety. © 2025 The Authors.

Each patient served as their own control. Data were extracted from electronic health records, including CAUTI rates, emergency department visits, catheter obstruction, hematuria, and microbial resistance patterns. McNemar's and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: SPCs were associated with a significantly lower incidence of CAUTIs (38% vs. 86%, p < 0.001) and reduced emergency department visits (35% vs. 68%, p < 0.001) compared to UCs. SPC use also resulted in fewer catheter obstructions (p = 0.003), lower hematuria rates (p = 0.003), and a reduced prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms",Comparative Outcomes of Indwelling Urethral Versus Suprapubic Catheters in Elderly Patients: A Retrospective Within-Subject Study,electronic health records,Review,,aim compare incidence catheter associated urinary tract infection cautis antibiotic resistance complication indwelling urethral catheter ucs suprapubic catheter spcs elderly patient method retrospective cohort study included elderly patient used uc least year subsequently transitioned spc least year patient served control data extracted electronic health record including cauti rate emergency department visit catheter obstruction hematuria microbial resistance pattern mcnemar wilcoxon signed rank test used statistical analysis result spcs associated significantly lower incidence cautis v reduced emergency department visit v compared ucs spc use also resulted fewer catheter obstruction lower hematuria rate reduced prevalence antibiotic resistant organism
"Digital Health Technologies represent a marked shift from current medical technologies in use, the approach to health and healthcare and stakeholders engaged in healthcare delivery. What the digitalized future of medicine will look like and how it should be governed is unclear. A participatory process with interdisciplinary expert groups developed scenarios of Artificial Intelligence use in medicine and recommendations on their governance. The process included a patient-consumer focus group and the recommendations were validated by a representative population survey in Switzerland. Digital twins were identified as a pivotal innovation for personalized healthcare, with 62% of the Swiss population expressing interest, though 87% oppose mandatory use. Additionally, 75% view the state as responsible for ensuring necessary infrastructure. Digital twins are seen as an opportunity to support both the healthcare provider as well as patient-consumer directly in different modes of use and along functions, prevention, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. © The Author(s)",A consensus statement on the use of digital twins in medicine,electronic health records,Article,,digital health technology represent marked shift current medical technology use approach health healthcare stakeholder engaged healthcare delivery digitalized future medicine look like governed unclear participatory process interdisciplinary expert group developed scenario artificial intelligence use medicine recommendation governance process included patient consumer focus group recommendation validated representative population survey switzerland digital twin identified pivotal innovation personalized healthcare swiss population expressing interest though oppose mandatory use additionally view state responsible ensuring necessary infrastructure digital twin seen opportunity support healthcare provider well patient consumer directly different mode use along function prevention diagnosis prognosis therapy author
"BACKGROUND: Medication adherence varies across socioeconomic and demographic groups. Prior work has examined these relationships in selected populations and with zip code–level socioeconomic measures, but less is known about adherence patterns across all medications when using more granular community measures and location proxies.

"Background: COPD is a common diagnosis driving in-patient admissions. A major component of in-patient COPD management involves nebulized or inhaled bronchodilators. In many hospitals, the in-patient pharmacy limits medication availability and may auto-substitute short-acting nebulized bron-chodilators (SANBs) for long-acting inhalers (LAIs) to cut costs; the effect of such policy change on patient care is unknown. Methods: We performed a retrospective, observational study at a quaternary teaching hospital to ana-lyze respiratory therapy utilization in subjects with COPD on home LAI, who were admitted between December 1, 2022–February 28, 2023. We compared resource utilization between the following groups: SANB only, LAI + as-needed SANB, and LAI + scheduled SANB. Results: We reviewed 302 admissions.

"Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression is associated with a significant incremental economic burden. Previous work has demonstrated high accuracy of the laboratory-based machine learning model, Klinrisk, in predicting the risk of CKD progression. We sought to use the Klinrisk model to evaluate the association of risk of CKD progression with healthcare resource utilization (HRU) and costs of care in adults with type 2 diabetes and CKD. Methods: This retrospective observational study included 413,177 eligible patients from Optum’s electronic health records database (1/1/2007–9/30/2022). Patients were classified into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups based on their 2-year risk of CKD progression as predicted by the Klinrisk model. All-cause HRU and medical costs during the 1 year after CKD were estimated for each group. Results: Of the 413,177 patients included, 110,399 (26.7%) were classified as low-risk of CKD progression, 253,188 (61.3%) as medium-risk, and 49,590 (12.0%) as high-risk.

"Observational COVID-19 studies often rely on diagnostic codes, but their accuracy and potential for differential misclassification across patient subgroups are unclear. In this proof of concept study, we examined age, race, and ethnicity as predictors of differential misclassification by comparing the classification accuracy of diagnostic codes to classifiers based on natural language processing (NLP) of clinical notes. We assessed differential misclassification in two primary care-based samples from the American Family Cohort: first, a cohort of 5000 patients with COVID-19 status assessed by physicians based on notes; and second, 21 659 patients (of 1 560 564) who received COVID-specific antivirals. Using annotated note data, we trained and tested three NLP classifiers (tree-based, recurrent neural network, and transformer-based). Approximately 63% of likely COVID-19 patients in the two samples had a documented ICD-10 code for COVID-19. Sensitivity was highest among younger patients (68.6% for <18 years versus 60.6% for those 75+), and for",Natural language processing improves reliable identification of COVID-19 compared to diagnostic codes alone,electronic health records,Article,,observational covid study often rely diagnostic code accuracy potential differential misclassification across patient subgroup unclear proof concept study examined age race ethnicity predictor differential misclassification comparing classification accuracy diagnostic code classifier based natural language processing nlp clinical note assessed differential misclassification two primary care based sample american family cohort first cohort patient covid status assessed physician based note second patient received covid specific antiviral using annotated note data trained tested three nlp classifier tree based recurrent neural network transformer based approximately likely covid patient two sample documented icd code covid sensitivity highest among younger patient year versus
"BACKGROUND Self-measured blood pressure is an important tool for diagnosing and controlling hypertension. Current insurance coverage for home blood pressure monitors varies widely, creating potential barriers to implementation. METHODS This observational study was conducted in a large, multisite Federally Qualified Health Center in Tucson, AZ, between 2023 and 2024. We compared prescription rates and fill rates during two 6-month periods: the final six months of grant-funded free monitor distribution (2023, n = 2,619 prescriptions, 2,357 fills) vs. the first 6 months after grant end when patients were charged approximately $35 (2024, n = 1,630 prescriptions, 974 fills). Data were extracted from the electronic health records system and analyzed using R version 4.2.3. RESULTS After cost-sharing implementation, two distinct effects reduced monitor distribution: prescription fill rates decreased from 90.0% to 59.8% (30.2% reduction, 95% CI [27.8%, 32.2%]), and providers sent 38% fewer prescriptions.

"Background: Sacroiliac joint (SIJ) dysfunction is implicated in 15% to 25% of cases of chronic lower back pain, a leading cause of disability globally. Sacroiliac joint fusion (SIJF) has become an increasingly utilized treatment for refractory SIJ pain, with its adoption projected to rise significantly. While SIJF can alleviate symptoms, many patients develop contralateral SIJ pathology requiring subsequent surgery. Understanding the incidence, timing, and risk factors for bilateral SIJF is critical for improving patient outcomes, managing expectation, and guiding surgical decision-making. This study aimed to (1) determine the incidence of bilateral SIJF, (2) assess the timing between initial ipsilateral and subsequent contralateral SIJF, (3) identify risk factors associated with progression to contralateral SIJF, and (4) compare the timing to contralateral SIJF between patients presenting with unilateral versus bilateral SIJ dysfunction. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted identifying 323 consecutive SIJFs performed between 2011 and 2024 at an integrated healthcare system.","Sacroiliac joint fusion: incidence, timing, and risk factors for contralateral fusion",electronic health records,Article,,background sacroiliac joint sij dysfunction implicated case chronic lower back pain leading cause disability globally sacroiliac joint fusion sijf become increasingly utilized treatment refractory sij pain adoption projected rise significantly sijf alleviate symptom many patient develop contralateral sij pathology requiring subsequent surgery understanding incidence timing risk factor bilateral sijf critical improving patient outcome managing expectation guiding surgical decision making study aimed determine incidence bilateral sijf assess timing initial ipsilateral subsequent contralateral sijf identify risk factor associated progression contralateral sijf compare timing contralateral sijf patient presenting unilateral versus bilateral sij dysfunction method retrospective review conducted identifying consecutive sijfs performed integrated healthcare system

"With the proliferation of multi-source data and heightened privacy protection demands, securing data while preserving privacy has emerged as a critical challenge for organizations. Current multi-source data analysis approaches frequently fail to adequately capture temporal dependencies and inter-data correlations, limiting their ability to identify patterns and forecast trends effectively. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Federated Trusted Network (FTN), which combines a Variable Forgetting LSTM module (VF-LSTM) and a Heterogeneous Aggregation GCN module (HA-GCN). The VF-LSTM module introduces a dynamic forgetting mechanism to flexibly capture temporal dependencies across different data types, while the HA-GCN module mines inherent correlations between different types of data through meta-path-based feature aggregation. Furthermore, FTN ensures data privacy and security by deploying trusted computing technology on local models across different application scenarios. Secure aggregation techniques are employed to integrate local model updates and generate a global model on the central server, enabling the identification",Dynamic memory-enhanced federated learning framework with trusted computing for multi-source data analysis,electronic health records,Article,,proliferation multi source data heightened privacy protection demand securing data preserving privacy emerged critical challenge organization current multi source data analysis approach frequently fail adequately capture temporal dependency inter data correlation limiting ability identify pattern forecast trend effectively address challenge paper proposes federated trusted network ftn combine variable forgetting lstm module vf lstm heterogeneous aggregation gcn module ha gcn vf lstm module introduces dynamic forgetting mechanism flexibly capture temporal dependency across different data type ha gcn module mine inherent correlation different type data meta path based feature aggregation furthermore ftn ensures data privacy security deploying trusted computing technology local model across different application scenario secure aggregation technique employed integrate local model update generate global model central server enabling identification
Background: Delayed or missed stroke diagnosis is associated with poor outcomes. We utilized natural language processing of notes from non-neurological emergency department (ED) encounters to identify text phrases indicating stroke presentations that are associated with stroke hospitalization 30 days after ED discharge. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of stroke (case) and gastroenteritis (matched-control) patients at two academic medical centers who had an ED encounter 30 days before index admission diagnosis. Medical concepts were extracted from the ED encounter notes. Statistical analysis was used to detect neurological text markers indicating stroke signs and symptoms using data from one hospital (discovery cohort) and validated in the second (validation cohort). We further compared the coefficients and the predictive performance of an elastic net model of both cohorts. Results: We detected 58 medical concepts with a statistically significant positive association with stroke cases in the discovery cohort of 987 patients (51 % stroke).,Identification of neurological text markers associated with risk of stroke,electronic health records,Article,,background delayed missed stroke diagnosis associated poor outcome utilized natural language processing note non neurological emergency department ed encounter identify text phrase indicating stroke presentation associated stroke hospitalization day ed discharge method conducted retrospective analysis stroke case gastroenteritis matched control patient two academic medical center ed encounter day index admission diagnosis medical concept extracted ed encounter note statistical analysis used detect neurological text marker indicating stroke sign symptom using data one hospital discovery cohort validated second validation cohort compared coefficient predictive performance elastic net model cohort result detected medical concept statistically significant positive association stroke case discovery cohort patient stroke

"Large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) represent the cutting-edge in artificial intelligence. This review provides a comprehensive overview of their capabilities and potential impact on radiology. Unlike most existing literature reviews focusing solely on LLMs, this work examines both LLMs and MLLMs, highlighting their potential to support radiology workflows such as report generation, image interpretation, EHR summarization, differential diagnosis generation, and patient education. By streamlining these tasks, LLMs and MLLMs could reduce radiologist workload, improve diagnostic accuracy, support interdisciplinary collaboration, and ultimately enhance patient care. We also discuss key limitations, such as the limited capacity of current MLLMs to interpret 3D medical images and to integrate information from both image and text data, as well as the lack of effective evaluation methods.

"Background: The optimal timing of cytoreductive surgery for advanced high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC) remains a critical unmet question in the modern era of platinum-based chemotherapy and PARP inhibitor (PARPi) maintenance. To address this gap, we compared outcomes following primary debulking surgery (PDS) versus interval debulking surgery (IDS) in a uniformly treated, contemporary cohort. Methods: Patients with FIGO stage IIIB–IVB HGSC treated between 2019 and 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. Baseline tumor burden was assessed using detailed radiologic and laparoscopic evaluations, including both presurgical and intraoperative assessments. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models and reported as adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs). Subgroup analyses were rigorously conducted according to residual disease status and BRCA mutation status. Results: Among 221 patients (PDS, n = 60; IDS, n = 151), the median follow-up was 40 months.

"Precision medicine aims to provide personalized healthcare for patients by stratifying them into subgroups based on their health conditions, enabling the development of tailored medical management. Various decision support systems (DSSs) are increasingly developed in this field, where the performance is limited to their capability of handling big amounts of heterogeneous and high-dimensional electronic health records (EHRs). In this paper, we focus on developing a deep learning model for patient stratification that can identify and explain patient subgroups from multimodal EHRs. The primary challenge is to effectively align and unify heterogeneous information from various modalities, which includes both unstructured and structured data. Here, we develop a Contrastive Multimodal learning model for EHR (ConMEHR) based on topic modelling. In ConMEHR, modality-level and topic-level contrastive learning (CL) mechanisms are adopted to obtain a unified representation space and diversify patient subgroups, respectively. The performance of ConMEHR will be evaluated on two real-world EHR",A decision support system in precision medicine: contrastive multimodal learning for patient stratification,electronic health records,Article,,precision medicine aim provide personalized healthcare patient stratifying subgroup based health condition enabling development tailored medical management various decision support system dsss increasingly developed field performance limited capability handling big amount heterogeneous high dimensional electronic health record ehrs paper focus developing deep learning model patient stratification identify explain patient subgroup multimodal ehrs primary challenge effectively align unify heterogeneous information various modality includes unstructured structured data develop contrastive multimodal learning model [Cluster] conmehr based topic modelling conmehr modality level topic level contrastive learning cl mechanism adopted obtain unified representation space diversify patient subgroup respectively performance conmehr evaluated two real world [Cluster]

"We propose a new solution for the Emergency Department (ED) staffing and scheduling problem, considering uncertainty in patient arrival patterns, multiple treatment stages, and resource capacity. A two-stage stochastic mathematical programming model was developed. We employed a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) method to generate scenarios and a discrete event simulation to evaluate the results. The model was applied in a large hospital, with 72,988 medical encounters and 85 physicians in a ten-month period. Compared to the hospital's actual scheduling, we obtained an overall average waiting time reduction from 54.6 (54.0–55.1) to 16.8 (16.7–17.0) minutes and an average Length of Stay reduction from 102.1 (101.7–102.4) to 64.3 (64.2–64.5) minutes. Therefore, this study offers a stochastic model that effectively addresses uncertainties in EDs, aligning physician schedules with patient arrivals and potentially improving the quality of service by reducing waiting times. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

"Background: Prolotherapy (proliferative therapy) is a nonsurgical regenerative injection technique that introduces small amounts of hyperosmolar dextrose to the site of painful or degenerated tendons or their insertions. Under ultrasound guidance, a 25-gauge needle is used to fenestrate and inject hyperosmolar dextrose into the injured area of the Achilles ten-don. This is found to induce the proliferation of new cells, allowing the regeneration of healthy tissue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the treatment response to prolo-therapy in Achilles tendinitis. Methods: We reviewed 132 participants with nontraumatic Achilles tendinopathy. Data were collected retrospectively from electronic health records from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017. These participants have Achilles tendinopathy from daily activity.

"In the healthcare industry, the ever-increasing volume of clinical trial data presents challenges for ensuring drug safety and detecting adverse drug reactions (ADRs). This study aims to address the challenge of accurately detecting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in pharmacovigilance, a critical component in ensuring drug safety during and after clinical trials. The key problem lies in the underreporting and delayed detection of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) due to the heterogeneous nature of medical data, class imbalance, and the limited scope of traditional monitoring techniques. This study proposes a hybrid AI-driven framework that integrates structured (e.g., patient demographics, lab results) and unstructured data (e.g., clinical notes) to detect ADRs using advanced deep learning and NLP methods. The objective is to outperform traditional signal detection methods and provide interpretable predictions to aid clinicians in real-time.

"The Elderly people’s freedom and health are seriously threatened by falls, which can often lead to serious injuries and a reduced quality of life. Falls are a major threat to elderly health and independence. Existing fall detection systems rely on wearables, which can be inconvenient. This proposal explores a camera-based system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs excel at recognizing patterns in visual data. Here, the system would continuously analyse real-time video to identify changes in posture, gait, and environmental hazards that signal fall risk. By learning from a large dataset, the CNN would predict falls well before they happen, unlike reactive systems that only detect falls after they occur. This proactive approach allows caregivers and emergency services to intervene sooner, potentially preventing falls or lessening injuries. This technology has the potential to improve senior safety and well-being, allowing them to live more independently with confidence. © The Author(s), under",Elderly Fall Detection Model for Patient Care Using Improvised CNN,electronic health records,Conference paper,,elderly people freedom health seriously threatened fall often lead serious injury reduced quality life fall major threat elderly health independence existing fall detection system rely wearable inconvenient proposal explores camera based system using convolutional neural network cnns cnns excel recognizing pattern visual data system would continuously analyse real time video identify change posture gait environmental hazard signal fall risk learning large dataset cnn would predict fall well happen unlike reactive system detect fall occur proactive approach allows caregiver emergency service intervene sooner potentially preventing fall lessening injury technology potential improve senior safety well allowing live independently confidence author
"Background: Functional biomarkers in neurodevelopmental disorders, such as verbal and ambulatory abilities, are essential for clinical care and research activities. Treatment planning, intervention monitoring, and identifying comorbid conditions in individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) rely on standardized assessments of these abilities. However, traditional assessments impose a burden on patients and providers, often leading to longitudinal inconsistencies and inequities due to evolving guidelines and associated time–cost. Therefore, this study aimed to develop an automated approach to classify verbal and ambulatory abilities from EHR data of IDD and cerebral palsy (CP) patients. Application of large language models (LLMs) to clinical notes, which are rich in longitudinal data, may provide a low-burden pipeline for extracting functional biomarkers efficiently and accurately.

"Purpose of Review: To define the emerging role of artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiography (AI-ECG) in advancing population-level screening for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), we provide a comprehensive overview of its role in predicting major adverse cardiovascular events and detecting subclinical coronary artery disease. We also outline the clinical, methodological, and implementation challenges that must be addressed for widespread adoption. Recent Findings: State-of-the-art AI-ECG models exhibit high accuracy, correctly re-classifying patients deemed ‘low risk’ by traditional risk models. They also compress the prediction horizon from a decade to just a few years, suggesting opportunities for early detection and more personalized intervention. However, validation remains largely retrospective and hospital-based, with referral and ascertainment biases limiting generalizability. There is no evidence thus far for an externally validated AI-ECG model that can either define or improve the detection of ASCVD outcomes independent of standard risk factors.

"The increased utilization of echocardiography in clinical practice has witnessed a substantial rise, underscoring its pivotal role as a diagnostic tool for various cardiovascular conditions. However, due to the relative scarcity of echocardiography tests, challenges persist in efficiently prioritizing patients for echocardiographic assessments. In this study, we develop a model to assess the urgency of appointments by considering both clinical and administrative variables extracted from Electronic Health Record data. We use double machine learning techniques to analyze these variables and improve our predictions of patient urgency. Traditional methods for estimating variable effects have limitations, particularly in our research context, where clinical and administrative variables may influence one another while also directly impacting the outcome (i.e., the urgency of appointments).

"Objectives: In electronic health record (EHR)-based association studies, phenotyping algorithms efficiently classify patient clinical outcomes into binary categories but are susceptible to misclassification errors. The gold standard, manual chart review, involves clinicians determining the true disease status based on their assessment of health records. These clinicians-labeled phenotypes are labor-intensive and typically limited to a small subset of patients, potentially introducing a third “undecided” category when phenotypes are indeterminate. We aim to effectively integrate the algorithm-derived and chart-reviewed outcomes when both are available in EHR-based association studies.

"The extent to which inpatient hospital costs for children and young patients (CYP) from the priority population in Australia differ from their peers is unknown. Using a multivariate analysis approach, this study (1) investigated variations in inpatient hospital costs between priority and non-priority CYP; and (2) identified the associations between CYP patient characteristics and inpatient hospital costs. Priority populations were defined as Indigenous Australian, National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) participants and refugee/asylum seeking CYP. They were identified using electronic medical records (EMRs) within the Sydney Children’s Hospitals Network (SCHN). Data from inpatient hospital admissions (public hospitals) by CYP aged 0–17 years between January 2015 and December 2019 within the SCHN were collected from the EMRs. This study employed mixed-effects generalised linear models (GLMMs) with a log-link function and gamma distribution to investigate patient factors associated with inpatient hospital costs.

"Diabetes distress is defined as the emotional response to living with diabetes and the burden of intensive self-management. Despite the high prevalence of diabetes distress globally and across different populations, diabetes distress remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in both primary care and specialty settings. However, diabetes distress is highly responsive to clinical attention. Emerging evidence suggests that digital interventions such as mobile phone applications, comprehensive telehealth interventions, and artificial intelligence can provide accessible, personalized, and effective support for individuals experiencing diabetes distress. The purpose of this review is to present the latest evidence on assessing, diagnosing, and treating diabetes distress, with an emphasis on the role of digital technologies. By leveraging digital interventions and prioritizing routine screening, healthcare systems can enhance support for individuals with diabetes, ultimately improving both psychological well-being and clinical outcomes. Mobile phone applications are the most preferred digital intervention, in both older adult populations as well as","Digital technologies for the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of diabetes distress: A review of current evidence",electronic health records,Review,,diabetes distress defined emotional response living diabetes burden intensive self management despite high prevalence diabetes distress globally across different population diabetes distress remains underdiagnosed undertreated primary care specialty setting however diabetes distress highly responsive clinical attention emerging evidence suggests digital intervention mobile phone application comprehensive telehealth intervention artificial intelligence provide accessible personalized effective support individual experiencing diabetes distress purpose review present latest evidence assessing diagnosing treating diabetes distress emphasis role digital technology leveraging digital intervention prioritizing routine screening healthcare system enhance support individual diabetes ultimately improving psychological well clinical outcome mobile phone application preferred digital intervention older adult population well
"Electronic health records (EHRs) enable patients to access their health records anytime, from anywhere with internet connectivity. Yet not all Americans benefit from these innovations. EHRs can be hard to access for people with a range of disabilities. This lack of access perpetuates inequity and, thus, demands ethical and legal attention. Some federal laws and regulations require accessible EHRs, but even these protections can fall short.

"The aging population and need for elderly health management pose significant global challenges. Emerging technologies such as health tracking applications (HTAs) play a crucial role in promoting smart senior care and improving elderly health management. To enhance motivation and engagement among the elderly in using HTAs, incorporating game elements or ‘gamification’ has attracted growing attention. However, concerns have also emerged regarding the high cognitive demands and potential biases against games, particularly among the Chinese elderly, who represent about 25 % of the global aging population and are deeply influenced by low indulgent culture. Due to a lack of empirical evidence from both research and practice, it remains uncertain whether gamification can bring optimal experiences and enhance elderly engagement with health services, in the same way that it does for younger users. Therefore, we designed and conducted a controlled between-subjects vignette-based experiment among the Chinese elderly (N = 312).

"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of death, highlighting the urgent need for early, accurate, and interpretable diagnostic tools. However, many AI-based heart disease prediction models lack transparency, hindering their acceptance in clinical settings. This study proposes XAI-HD, a hybrid framework integrating machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and explainable AI (XAI) techniques for heart disease detection. The framework systematically addresses key challenges, including class imbalance, missing data, and feature inconsistency, through advanced preprocessing and class-balancing methods such as OSS, NCR, SMOTEN, ADASYN, SMOTETomek, and SMOTEENN. Comparative performance evaluations across multiple datasets (CHD, FHD, SHD) demonstrate that XAI-HD reduces classification error rates by 20–25% compared to traditional ML-based models, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, SHAP and LIME-based feature importance analysis enhances model interpretability, fostering trust among medical professionals.

"Background: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common and complex neurological conditions. Many TBI patients require ongoing rehabilitation beyond acute care, making treatment and discharge decisions critical. While individual risk factors for TBI outcomes are known, integrating comprehensive electronic health record (EHR) data into practical, validated prediction tools for personalized discharge planning and readmission risk assessment remains a key challenge. EHRs offer a valuable resource by integrating sociodemographic information, clinical care details, and prior healthcare encounters, providing an opportunity to develop models that predict key outcomes for TBI patients, such as discharge disposition and 30-day readmission. Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized EHRs from a large multi-hospital health system (2017–2023) to develop and validate statistical models predicting discharge disposition and 30-day readmission among hospitalized TBI patients, and to translate these models into an accessible clinical prediction tool.

"Cyberchondria refers to the compulsive behavior of excessively search for health-related information online, which can heighten anxiety about one’s health. While previous studies have identified numerous cognitive and emotional factors that contribute to cyberchondria, how individuals suffer from cyberchondria when they face complicated online system features warrants further investigation. This study introduces a moderated mediation model to explore the relationships between online system complexity, health advertising intrusiveness, health risk perception, health information skepticism and cyberchondria. Drawing on data from an online survey of 437 participants, the results indicate that system complexity is positively related to cyberchondria through health advertising intrusiveness and risk perception. Additionally, health information skepticism negatively moderates the effect of system complexity on health advertising intrusiveness.

"In the electronic medical record (EHR), few data items accurately represent the disease pathology itself. Therefore, we need algorithms to extract various diseases with the highest possible accuracy from the EHR. Therefore, we created and validated outcome definitions to identify six diseases from MID-NET, a Japanese large-scale infrastructure database of Data-driven medical studies established for drug safety by PMDA (Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency). Each definition was practical enough to use for a large-scale clinical database. In addition, PPVs and sensitivities differed between medical facilities, allowing us to identify issues in creating and operating definitions.

"Background/Objectives: Accurate assessment of spinal bone density is essential for evaluating bone health, particularly in preoperative planning. Conventional manual methods for Hounsfield unit (HU) measurements rely on single-slice measurements within the region of interest, limiting their precision and reproducibility in patients with severe vertebral deformities. We hypothesize that a novel deep-reasoning and learning model (DR-AI) can fully automate spinal bone density assessment volumetrically, with high correlations to spinal bone mineral density (BMD) obtained from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), as well as to the T- and Z-scores.

"Patient trajectories from electronic health records are widely used to estimate conditional average potential outcomes (CAPOs) of treatments over time, which then allows to personalize care. Yet, existing neural methods for this purpose have a key limitation: while some adjust for time-varying confounding, these methods assume that the time series are recorded in discrete time. In other words, they are constrained to settings where measurements and treatments are conducted at fixed time steps, even though this is unrealistic in medical practice. In this work, we aim to estimate CAPOs in continuous time. The latter is of direct practical relevance because it allows for modeling patient trajectories where measurements and treatments take place at arbitrary, irregular timestamps. We thus propose a new method called stabilized continuous time inverse propensity network (SCIP-Net). For this, we further derive stabilized inverse propensity weights for robust estimation of the CAPOs.

"Palliative care is known to improve quality of life in advanced cancer. Natural language processing offers insights to how documentation around palliative care in relation to metastatic cancer has changed. We analyzed inpatient clinical notes using unsupervised language models that learn how words related to metastatic cancer (e.g. “mets”, “metastases”) and palliative care (e.g. “palliative care”, “pal care”) appear relationally and change over time. We included any note from adults hospitalized at the University of California, San Francisco system. The primary outcome was how similarly terms related to metastatic cancer and palliative care appeared in notes using a mathematical approach (cosine similarity). We used word2vec to model language numerically as vectors. Relational data between vectors was captured using cosine similarity.

"Community pharmacists play a critical role in medication management, patient education, and chronic disease support. Yet their ability to provide safe, coordinated, and efficient care is often hindered by limited access to essential clinical information such as medication histories, allergy records, laboratory results, and chronic condition details. Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comprehensive digital systems that enable information sharing across healthcare providers, offer a promising solution. This analysis explores how EHRs can empower community pharmacists to deliver more informed, integrated, and patient-centred care. It also identifies key barriers to pharmacist engagement, including restricted system access, fragmented digital infrastructure, limited interoperability, and insufficient training in digital health tools. To address these challenges, system-level reforms are needed such as investment in digital connectivity, policy changes to formally recognise pharmacists as core members of multidisciplinary care teams, and practical strategies for EHR integration into community pharmacy practice. © 2025, Australasian College of Health Service",IMPLEMENTING ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS IN COMMUNITY PHARMACY PRACTICE: INSIGHTS FROM DEVELOPED HEALTH SYSTEMS,electronic health records,Note,,community pharmacist play critical role medication management patient education chronic disease support yet ability provide safe coordinated efficient care often hindered limited access essential clinical information medication history allergy record laboratory result chronic condition detail electronic health record ehrs comprehensive digital system enable information sharing across healthcare provider offer promising solution analysis explores ehrs empower community pharmacist deliver informed integrated patient centred care also identifies key barrier pharmacist engagement including restricted system access fragmented digital infrastructure limited interoperability insufficient training digital health tool address challenge system level reform needed investment digital connectivity policy change formally recognise pharmacist core member multidisciplinary care team practical strategy [Cluster] integration community pharmacy practice australasian college health service
"TP53 mutations are common in breast cancer (BC) and are associated with poor prognosis. GD3 synthase (GD3S/ST8SIA1), a gene associated with breast cancer stem cells, is upregulated in tumors with p53 mutations. However, the functional relationship between GD3S and p53 is unknown. Here, we show that GD3S levels are highest in breast tumors with specific p53 mutations. Functional studies revealed that wild-type (WT) p53 inhibits GD3S expression, whereas mutation in p53 enhances GD3S expression by upregulating GD3S promoter activity. Moreover, we found that GD3S inhibits wild-type p53–induced apoptosis in BC cells, while BC cells harboring gain-of-function p53 mutations are dependent on GD3S for their growth. Mechanistic insights indicate that GD3S strengthens mitochondrial function by regulating their oxygen consumption rate and membrane polarity. Our findings demonstrate that specific GOF p53 mutations rely on GD3S to exert their tumor-promoting effects and that GD3S is a novel anti-apoptotic factor in BC cells.

"Healthcare monitoring requires precise and efficient methods to monitor individual health measurements, particularly for diseases with well-defined clinical ranges. Traditional control charts struggle to handle uncertainty in medical data, necessitating more flexible approaches. This study introduces two novel fuzzy control charts: the fuzzy moving average control chart (FMACC) and the fuzzy weighted moving average control chart (FWMACC), which utilize trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (TrFNs) to enhance monitoring capabilities. An α-cut midrange approach is applied to better capture variability, and fuzzy process capability indices (FPCIs) are incorporated to assess process performance under uncertain conditions. The proposed method is applied to creatinine and PCR data, demonstrating its versatility in health monitoring. Monte Carlo simulations validate the effectiveness of FMACC and FWMACC, confirming their superior performance in detecting small process shifts.

"The silent progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major problem particularly in CVD prevention. New techniques enabled by the rise of electronic health records may facilitate CVD prevention. Both public health research and big data applications, such as digital twins, are dependent on access to longitudinal and sensitive data; a challenge which may be facilitated by access to longitudinal synthetic data. In this study, we establish a fidelity benchmark for longitudinal synthetic data by extending a well-known method for cross-sectional synthetic data to a longitudinal application within CVD. We find that the univariate distributional difference between the real and the synthetic data is kept low and that pairwise relations are preserved in the synthetic data. Further, we see that the variablewise temporal trends are preserved, yet may be more extensively studied and have some room for improvement.

"Accurately labeling outcomes in real-world data for machine learning is challenging due to data sparsity and imbalances. This study developed and evaluated a pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PKPD)-informed labeling strategy to enhance the risk prediction of docetaxel-induced neutropenia. Machine learning models were trained on real-world data from 4,248 patients using two approaches for comparison. The “naive” labeling method used only neutrophil observations, while the “PKPD-informed” method used simulations from a semi-mechanistic model to determine the neutrophil nadir for each treatment cycle. Three machine learning models (logistic regression, XGBoost, TabPFN) were trained with baseline laboratory data to predict severe neutropenia (neutrophil count <0.1 cells × 109/L) prior to the first docetaxel dose. The PKPD labeling approach enabled the labeling of 3.4 times more patient instances (7,719 vs. 2,283) than the naive method.

"Many clinically significant health conditions in older adults are underreported or only recorded in unstructured health records. These records, however, contain valuable information for patient care and prognosis. This study utilized 10.6 million free-text entries from the electronic health records of 102,525 patients aged 50–80 across various care settings in Finland from 2010 to 2022. A deep learning-based natural language processing model was employed to perform named entity recognition (NER) to identify falls, incontinence, loneliness, and mobility limitations from the free-text entries. The performance of the NER models was evaluated by precision, recall and F1 scores. Diagnostic codes for incontinence and falls were collected for comparisons. Cox regression models were used to assess the predictive value of the identified conditions for all-cause mortality. The NER models demonstrated excellent performance with recall, precision and F1 scores greater than 0.80 across the health conditions.

"Introduction: Paraspinal myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) is a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits, but existing therapies often provide incomplete or short-lived relief. Increasing evidence implicates the fascia as a key driver of the pain in MPS, supporting targeted interfascial interventions. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective observational cohort study of adult ED patients who received a novel, ultrasound-guided paravertebral fascial plane block (PFPB) between September 1, 2024 – August 31, 2025. Eligible patients presented with focal cervical, thoracic, or lumbar paraspinal pain consistent with MPS and had either inadequate response to ED analgesics or a history of refractory paraspinal MPS. The PFPB procedure consisted of two components: (1) injection of a combination of anesthetic, normal saline, and dexamethasone within the fascial planes between the paraspinal muscles, and (2) needling of the muscular fasciae.

"Background: Blood transfusions are the most common procedure performed in American hospitals. The steps required for blood product delivery are often misunderstood by providers, leading to numerous phone calls to the blood bank requesting order status. Distracting calls can lengthen turnaround time, especially during blood product or staff shortages. We sought a tool to address these questions and reduce distraction. This study highlights a novel blood tracker tool implemented in the electronic health record (EHR) that allows providers to see their blood order's status. Study Design and Methods: With a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, we constructed a user-friendly blood tracker highly visible in our EHR. It shows the status of a blood product in real time from “order printed” to “preparing” to “on its way.” We surveyed blood bank technologists to determine if call volume and distraction changed.

"Hospitals have implemented health information technology (HIT) for clinical care to address rising operating costs in recent years. We integrate behavioral and institutional perspectives to explain how hospitals differentiate technological search relative to industry peers (i.e., search differentiation) for HIT portfolios. In the context of the U.S. healthcare industry, we theorize that hospitals’ search differentiation for HIT results jointly from idiosyncratic learning in response to cost-based performance shortfalls and isomorphic pressures in relation to changing policy uncertainty as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act has unfolded. Based on a panel data set from 3,319 hospitals in 2007–2014, we demonstrate that when costs increase relative to aspiration level, a hospital differentiates its search for HIT by exploring more novel technologies for clinical care relative to peers. As policy uncertainty declines from the conceptualization phase to the enactment phase of the HITECH Act, a hospital’s search differentiation",How Hospitals Differentiate Health Information Technology Portfolios for Clinical Care Efficiency: Insights from the HITECH Act,electronic health records,Article,,hospital implemented health information technology hit clinical care address rising operating cost recent year integrate behavioral institutional perspective explain hospital differentiate technological search relative industry peer search differentiation hit portfolio context healthcare industry theorize hospital search differentiation hit result jointly idiosyncratic learning response cost based performance shortfall isomorphic pressure relation changing policy uncertainty health information technology economic clinical health hitech act unfolded based panel data set hospital demonstrate cost increase relative aspiration level hospital differentiates search hit exploring novel technology clinical care relative peer policy uncertainty decline conceptualization phase enactment phase hitech act hospital search differentiation
"Access to postpartum care (PPC) varies in the US and little data exists about whether patient factors may influence receipt of care.

"The digital transformation of healthcare has introduced online healthcare services that offer unprecedented accessibility and convenience. However, the shift to virtual doctor-patient interactions has unveiled new challenges in ensuring patient satisfaction. Prior research has primarily focused on the doctor's perspective, with scant attention given to the patient's perception of informational and emotional support within these digital interactions. Drawing the perspective from Media Synchronicity Theory, this study investigates how online healthcare interaction patterns influence patient perceived satisfaction of informational support and emotional support, and how different interaction patterns across varied media types impact these satisfaction facets. Through an empirical analysis of 7374 patient consultation records from ""www.haodf.com"", this study analyzes the influence of interaction pattern such as doctors' response time, interaction rounds, frequency and media synchronicity in patients' satisfaction.

"Rare and intractable diseases affect an estimated 3.5% to 5.9% of the global population but remain largely underserved in terms of diagnosis and treatment, with effective therapies available for only about 5% of conditions. This paper presents an overview of recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) applications targeting these challenges. In diagnostic support, AI has been utilized to analyze genomic data and facial images, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of identifying rare genetic syndromes. In therapeutic development, AI-driven analysis of biomedical knowledge graphs has enabled the prediction of potential treatment candidates for diseases lacking existing therapies. Additionally, generative models have accelerated drug discovery by identifying novel targets and designing candidate compounds, some of which have progressed to clinical evaluation. AI has also facilitated clinical trial support by automating patient eligibility screening using electronic health records, improving recruitment efficiency for trials that often struggle with small, geographically dispersed patient populations.

"Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) significantly impacts global health, primarily due to frequent acute exacerbations caused by respiratory infections. Precise microbial characterization may inform prognostic insights and optimize clinical management. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study from December 2023 to February 2025 involving 1146 patients (259 COPD; 887 non-COPD) with suspected respiratory infections. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) and conventional microbiological testing. Multivariate logistic regression identified COPD predictors, and machine learning modeled prognostic outcomes based on microbial profiles. Results: Distinct pathogen distributions emerged between COPD and non-COPD groups, with COPD patients exhibiting higher prevalence of gram-negative bacteria, particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae, and fungal pathogens.

"Clinical decisions to treat and diagnose patients are affected by implicit biases formed by racism, ableism, sexism, and other stereotypes. These biases reflect broader systemic discrimination in healthcare and risk marginalizing already disadvantaged groups. Existing methods for measuring implicit biases require controlled randomized testing and only capture individual attitudes rather than outcomes. However, the ""big-data"" revolution has led to the availability of large observational medical datasets, like EHRs and biobanks, that provide the opportunity to investigate discrepancies in patient health outcomes. In this work, we propose a causal inference approach to detect the effect of clinician implicit biases on patient outcomes in large-scale medical data. Specifically, our method uses proximal mediation to disentangle pathway-specific effects of a patient's sociodemographic attribute on a clinician's diagnosis decision. We test our method on real-world data from the UK Biobank.

"The study addresses the problem of explaining the prediction results of machine learning models, developing methods for phenotyping risk factors, and predicting in-hospital mortality (IHM) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). For IHM prediction, risk factors were identified and their phenotypes were formed, providing not only transparency of decision-making but also improving prediction quality. Two methods were proposed for extracting risk factors and forming their phenotypes: entropy minimization and search for a separating curve based on AUC maximization. These methods were applied to a dataset of 4673 electronic health records of patients with STEMI and IHM prediction after emergency PCI. Risk factor phenotypes were identified, and IHM predictive models were developed based on them. The results demonstrated that the multifactor logistic regression (MLR) prediction model, with phenotypes identified by the entropy minimization method as predictors, was inferior in prediction accuracy to the MLR",An Interpretable Predictive Model of In-Hospital Mortality in Patients with Myocardial Infarction Based on Risk Factor Phenotypes,electronic health records,Conference paper,,study address problem explaining prediction result machine learning model developing method phenotyping risk factor predicting hospital mortality ihm patient st segment elevation myocardial infarction stemi percutaneous coronary intervention pci ihm prediction risk factor identified phenotype formed providing transparency decision making also improving prediction quality two method proposed extracting risk factor forming phenotype entropy minimization search separating curve based auc maximization method applied dataset electronic health record patient stemi ihm prediction emergency pci risk factor phenotype identified ihm predictive model developed based result demonstrated multifactor logistic regression mlr prediction model phenotype identified entropy minimization method predictor inferior prediction accuracy mlr

"Visualizing the correlations between structured data features is of central importance for effective and efficient data analysis and decision-making. In this paper, we present a new unsupervised semi-structured and feature-based tool for interactive data visualization titled “mirrored dendrograms”. It accepts as input semi-structured and multi-featured data, and allows the user to select the target features to be visualized and mapped against each other, and their relative impacts (weights) on the visualization process. It then invokes a hierarchical clustering process to cluster the data following the user-chosen features, and produces a dendrogram structure for each combination of target features. The dendrograms are mirrored against each other by mapping their nodes using the transportation optimization problem. Different from existing solutions like tanglegram and cluster heatmap, mirrored dendrograms offers three main contributions: (i) connecting the dendrograms through their internal nodes to describe their structure relationships (instead of connecting their leaf nodes only), (ii)",Mirrored dendrograms: An unsupervised semi-structured and feature-based interactive data visualization tool,electronic health records,Article,,visualizing correlation structured data feature central importance effective efficient data analysis decision making paper present new unsupervised semi structured feature based tool interactive data visualization titled mirrored dendrograms accepts input semi structured multi featured data allows user select target feature visualized mapped relative impact weight visualization process invokes hierarchical clustering process cluster data following user chosen feature produce dendrogram structure combination target feature dendrograms mirrored mapping node using transportation optimization problem different existing solution like tanglegram cluster heatmap mirrored dendrograms offer three main contribution connecting dendrograms internal node describe structure relationship instead connecting leaf node ii

"Background: Surgery with systematic lymph node (LN) dissection remains the primary treatment for early-stage and locally advanced operable non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the effect of the log odds of negative lymph nodes/T stage (LONT) in NSCLC remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between LONT and prognosis of stage I–III NSCLC patients who underwent resection. Methods: Clinical data from patients who underwent NSCLC resection were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The log odds of negative LONT, defined as log(NLNs + 1)/T stage, was calculated for each patient. The nonlinear relationship between LONT and overall survival (OS) and lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) was evaluated using the cubic spline smoothing technique and Cox regression. The optimal LONT cut-off point was determined using X-tile plots, and propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to minimize inter-group differences.

"Objective: Risk prediction models are used in hospitals to identify pediatric patients at risk of clinical deterioration, enabling timely interventions and rescue. The objective of this study was to develop a new explainer algorithm that uses a patient’s clinical notes to generate text-based explanations for risk prediction alerts. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 39 406 patient admissions to the American Family Children’s Hospital at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (2009-2020). The pediatric Calculated Assessment of Risk and Triage (pCART) validated risk prediction model was used to identify children at risk for deterioration. A transformer model was trained to use clinical notes from the 12-hour period preceding each pCART score to predict whether a patient was flagged as at risk. Then, label-aware attention highlighted text phrases most important to an at-risk alert.

"Background: Critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) are at increased risk for multidrug-resistant infections and infection-related mortality. Altered pharmacokinetics in CRRT may contribute to inadequate antimicrobial exposure and therapeutic failure. However, limited data exist on infection burden and resistance patterns specific to this population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of ICU patients receiving continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) at a tertiary academic center between May 2016 and April 2020. Patients were included if they received CRRT for ≥ 48 h, had at least one positive microbial culture, and received at least one antimicrobial of interest. Data were collected on infection sources, pathogens, resistance patterns, and mortality. Results: Among 661 CRRT recipients, 394 (59.6%) had at least one positive culture. The most common infection sites were respiratory (69.0%), skin and soft tissue (53.8%), and intra-abdominal (38.8%).

"Purpose: To compare rates of revision surgery between primary endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) and open carpal tunnel release (OCTR). In addition, we aimed to assess the influence of fellowship training on revision rates. We hypothesized that ECTR would not be associated with higher rates of revision surgery. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, single-center replication study of a recently published comparative assessment of ECTR and OCTR. All patients between 18 and 75 years old undergoing primary ECTR or OCTR over a 6-year period were included if they were seen within 1 year after surgery. To control for confounding, adjusted binary logistic regression models were inverse-weighted by propensity scores. Early (12 months) and overall revision rates were compared between ECTR and OCTR, as were revision rates relative to surgeon training. Results: A total of 4,160 patients and 63 surgeons were included. Eighty-one percent underwent OCTR.

"OBJECTIVE Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) has demonstrated benefits across various surgical specialties. However, a significant research-practice gap remains, with fewer than half of spine surgeons incorporating ERAS principles into daily practice. A key barrier to ERAS implementation in spine surgery is postoperative compliance, as patients often express concerns about worsening pain. To address these challenges, the authors developed a standardized, delivery-focused ERAS clinical pathway (CP) for oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF). This study prospectively evaluated whether ERAS-CP can improve postoperative compliance without compromising pain control compared with conventional ERAS. METHODS This prospective, randomized noninferiority trial involved 41 patients undergoing OLIF from July 2023 to February 2024. Patients were randomized to either the ERAS-CP group (n = 21) or the control (conventional ERAS) group (n = 20). The ERAS-CP comprised a CP system integrated into the electronic health record system, patient education manual, and dedicated medical personnel support.

"Multiple studies have attempted to use a single type of data to predict various stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, combining multiple data modalities can improve prediction accuracy. In this study, we utilized a combination of biomarkers, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electronic health records, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), to classify subjects into three groups based on clinical tests—normal cognitive controls (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. To determine the significant parameters, we employ a novel technique that utilizes sparse autoencoders to extract features from CSF, clinical data, and convolutional neural networks’ (CNN’s) MRI imaging data. Our results indicate that deep learning methods outperform traditional machine learning models such as decision trees, support vector machines, random forests and K-nearest neighbors. The proposed method significantly outperforms traditional models, achieving an accuracy of 0.87 for CN versus AD, a precision of 0.93 for CN, and a recall of 0.88 for AD",Exploring the Potential of Convolutional Neural Networks in Classifying Alzheimer’s Stages with Multi-biomarker Approach,electronic health records,Article,,multiple study attempted use single type data predict various stage alzheimer disease ad however combining multiple data modality improve prediction accuracy study utilized combination biomarkers including magnetic resonance imaging mri electronic health record cerebrospinal fluid csf classify subject three group based clinical test normal cognitive control cn mild cognitive impairment mci ad determine significant parameter employ novel technique utilizes sparse autoencoders extract feature csf clinical data convolutional neural network cnn mri imaging data result indicate deep learning method outperform traditional machine learning model decision tree support vector machine random forest nearest neighbor proposed method significantly outperforms traditional model achieving accuracy cn versus ad precision cn recall ad
"Aims: Several methods exist to identify hospital admissions related to adverse drug events (ADEs). Clinical adjudication by healthcare professionals is the gold standard but is labour-intensive. Spontaneous reporting and routinely collected healthcare data using a set of International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes often underestimate the prevalence of ADE-related admissions. Expanding the set of ICD codes could improve detection; however, validation is limited. The objective was to describe the agreement between ADE-related ICD-10 codes and clinically adjudicated ADE-related admissions in 2 settings. Methods: This study analysed 2 datasets: 1102 readmissions from a hospital in the Netherlands (180 ADE-related) and 1228 admissions from a hospital in the Czech Republic (195 ADE-related).

"Background Anticholinergic medication use is associated with adverse clinical outcomes, especially in older adults. However, few studies have assessed the anticholinergic burden in the Thai geriatric population. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the impact of anticholinergic burden on clinical outcomes in older patients after discharge from the hospital. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted between January 1 to December 31, 2023. The prescribed medications were assessed at admission and discharge to determine the anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scores. Participants were classified into three groups according to the ACB score at discharge: none (score 0), moderate (score 1–2), and severe (score ≥ 3) anticholinergic burden. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to determine the marker risk of high anticholinergic burden to adverse outcomes. Results This study involved 290 older patients admitted to general internal medicine wards.

"In real-world problems such as robotics, finance and healthcare, randomness is always present, thus, it is important to take risk into consideration in order to limit the chance of rare but dangerous events. The literature on risk-averse reinforcement learning has produced many different approaches to tackle the problem, but they either struggle to scale up to complex instances, or they exhibit irrational behaviors. Here we present two novel risk-averse objectives that are both coherent and easy to optimize: the reward-based mean-mean absolute deviation (Mean-RMAD) and the reward-based conditional value at risk (RCVaR). Instead of reducing the return risk, these measures minimize the per-step reward one. We prove that these risk measures bound the corresponding return-based risk measures, so that they can be also used as proxies for their return-based versions. We develop safe algorithms for these risk measures with guaranteed monotonic improvement, and their practical trust-region versions. Furthermore, we propose",Risk-averse optimization of reward-based coherent risk measures,healthcare robotics,Article,,real world problem robotics finance healthcare randomness always present thus important take risk consideration order limit chance rare dangerous event literature risk averse reinforcement learning produced many different approach tackle problem either struggle scale complex instance exhibit irrational behavior present two novel risk averse objective coherent easy optimize reward based mean mean absolute deviation mean rmad reward based conditional value risk rcvar instead reducing return risk measure minimize per step reward one prove risk measure bound corresponding return based risk measure also used proxy return based version develop safe algorithm risk measure guaranteed monotonic improvement practical trust region version furthermore propose

"Background: One approach to evaluate decision-making is using the concept of decision regret, which measures patient remorse after a healthcare decision. This is particularly important for elective, preference-sensitive conditions with multiple treatment options, such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair. In this study, we assessed decision regret among patients who pursued surgical management of ventral and inguinal hernias. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed a statewide registry of adult patients who underwent elective ventral and inguinal hernia repair between January 2017 and March 2020 and completed a validated survey measuring decision regret. 30-day outcomes included complications, emergency department (ED) utilization, readmission, and reoperation. Multivariable logistic regression examined the association of regret with age, sex, race, insurance status, ASA, tobacco use, diabetes, admission status, surgical approach (open vs. laparoscopic vs. robotic), year, and outcomes.

"On-skin sensors capable of capturing human electrophysiological signals are valuable for a variety of areas, such as wearable health monitoring, prosthesis, human machine interfaces (HMI). Extensive research efforts have been devoted to developing on-skin electrodes and they offer potential advantages over conventional rigid electrodes. However, those approaches usually have limitations as they require sophisticated and costly fabrication processes to produce only a small number of electrodes. Here we report the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) electrodes prepared by simultaneous room temperature reduction and patterning process for scalable fabrication of a large number of on-skin electrodes. Due to the low thickness and adhesive substrate adopted, the rGO electrodes can form conformal contact with skin even during deformation, leading to reduced impedance in skin-electrode interface. The rGO electrodes have been successfully adopted for the measurements of electromyography (EMG), electrooculogram (EOG)and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals with high fidelity. And the implementation of a HMI task",On-skin graphene electrodes for large area electrophysiological monitoring and human-machine interfaces,healthcare robotics,Article,,skin sensor capable capturing human electrophysiological signal valuable variety area wearable health monitoring prosthesis human machine interface hmi extensive research effort devoted developing skin electrode offer potential advantage conventional rigid electrode however approach usually limitation require sophisticated costly fabrication process produce small number electrode report reduced graphene oxide rgo electrode prepared simultaneous room temperature reduction patterning process scalable fabrication large number skin electrode due low thickness adhesive substrate adopted rgo electrode form conformal contact skin even deformation leading reduced impedance skin electrode interface rgo electrode successfully adopted measurement electromyography emg electrooculogram eog electroencephalogram eeg signal high fidelity implementation hmi task
"Socially assistive robots are increasingly being researched and deployed in various domains such as education, healthcare, service, and even as collaborators in a variety of other workplaces. Similarly, SARs are also expected to interact in a socially acceptable manner with a wide audience, ranging from preschool children to the elderly. This diversity of application domains and target populations raises technical and social challenges that are yet to be overcome. While earlier works relied on the Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) paradigm to give an illusion of interactivity and intelligence, a transition toward more autonomous robots can be observed. In this article, we present a systematic review, following the PRISMA method, of the last 5 years of Socially Assistive Robotics research, centered around SARs’ level of autonomy with a stronger focus on fully and semi-autonomous robots than non-autonomous ones.

"Automated emotion recognition (AER) has a growing number of applications, ranging from behavior analysis in assistive robotics and e-learning to depression and pain estimation healthcare. Systems for multimodal AER typically outperform unimodal approaches due to the complementary and redundant semantic information across modalities like visual, audio, language, physiological, etc. However, in practice, only a subset of these modalities is available at inference time, and using multiple modalities increases systems complexity. This paper focuses on video-based AER and aims to enhance the accuracy of unimodal systems by leveraging the Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm with information from multiple modalities. Without loss of generality, this study considers the audio modality as privileged information (only available during training), and introduces a new multimodal to unimodal privileged knowledge distillation (PKD).

"This research addresses the need for robust proprioceptive methods that capture the continuous deformations of soft robots without relying on multiple sensors that hinder compliance. The authors propose a vision-based deformation learning strategy called latent proprioception, which anchors the robot's overall deformation state to a single internal reference frame tracked by a miniature onboard camera. Through a multi-modal neural network trained on simulated and real data, the authors unify motion, force, and shape measurements into a shared representation in latent codes, inferring unseen states from readily measured signals. The experimental results show that this approach accurately reconstructs full-body deformations and forces from minimal sensing data, enabling soft robots to adapt to complex object manipulation or safe human interaction tasks. The proposed framework exemplifies how a vision-based deformable learning approach can inform and enhance robotics by reducing sensor complexity and preserving mechanical flexibility.

"Reinforcement Learning is beginning to be applied outside traditional domains such as robotics, and into human-centric domains such as healthcare and education. In these domains, two problems are critical to address: We must be able to evaluate algorithms with a collection of prior data if one is available, and we must devise algorithms that carefully trade off exploration and exploitation in such a way that they are guaranteed to converge to optimal behavior quickly, while retaining very good performance with limited data.

"Achieving stable and versatile bipedal locomotion remains a major challenge in robotics, with applications in personal assistance, healthcare, and search and rescue. The hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) framework, based on virtual constraints, has shown strong potential for generating provably stable gaits. However, traditional HZD implementations often rely on simple feedback controllers that lack the ability to strictly enforce physical constraints, such as actuator limits and ground contact conditions during real-time execution. This paper presents a full-body, optimization-based walking controller for a bipedal robot that integrates virtual-constraints-based gait planning with online tracking using task-space inverse dynamics (TSID). A gait library is generated offline using two different sets of virtual constraints. It is shown that constraints based on the center of mass (CoM) relative to the feet improve optimization performance, achieving 8% fewer iterations, 12% faster convergence, and an 11.6% better objective value compared to classical constraint sets.

"Stretchable interconnects are essential for wearable, healthcare, and robotics technologies. While various electrode materials and architectures have been explored, developing stretchable composites that simultaneously achieve high electrical conductivity, strain stability, and strong adhesion remains challenging. High conductivity necessitates a high filler volume fraction, which increases viscosity, reduces electrical stability, and compromises adhesion during mechanical deformation. To address these limitations, we demonstrate stretchable conductive composites by incorporating short alkyl-chain dicarboxylic acids into Ag flake/silicone composites via a one-step blending process. This approach replaces the original lubricants on Ag flakes, improving dispersion and optimizing inter-flake attractive interactions. Both experimental and simulation results confirm that tuning the dicarboxylic acid chain length is critical for enhancing conductivity and network stability. Compared to composites with pristine Ag flakes, the addition of 0.5 wt% succinic acid significantly decreases the electrical resistivity by up to 5 orders of magnitude at 60 wt% Ag content and achieves a",High-performance stretchable conductive composites for washable textile electronics via intermolecular interaction control,healthcare robotics,Article,,stretchable interconnects essential wearable healthcare robotics technology various electrode material architecture explored developing stretchable composite simultaneously achieve high electrical conductivity strain stability strong adhesion remains challenging high conductivity necessitates high filler volume fraction increase viscosity reduces electrical stability compromise adhesion mechanical deformation address limitation demonstrate stretchable conductive composite incorporating short alkyl chain dicarboxylic acid ag flake silicone composite via one step blending process approach replaces original lubricant ag flake improving dispersion optimizing inter flake attractive interaction experimental simulation result confirm tuning dicarboxylic acid chain length critical enhancing conductivity network stability compared composite pristine ag flake addition wt succinic acid significantly decrease electrical resistivity order magnitude wt ag content achieves

"The surge in infectious and chronic diseases, coupled with the increasing number of independent-living elderly individuals, has made remote patient monitoring (RPM) crucial for healthcare service. Sensors technology and the Internet of Things produce numerous small robotics devices for collecting multi-modal data on relevant physiological parameters. These are subsequently analyzed to predict health conditions in time to save patients’ lives. Range-specific physiological data analysis is very crucial in RPM systems. According to the literature, deep learning effectively analyzes this data type. However, its low explainability and high resource dependency motivate us to conduct a comparative study on how various machine learning (ML) approaches can enhance RPM. This study compares the performance of decision trees, random forest, and support vector machine algorithms on two publicly available RPM medical datasets from Kaggle. We evaluate these ML techniques for RPM in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and sensitivity.

"Natural hydrogels like gelatin are ideal for fabricating sensors that monitor human body signals due to their excellent biocompatibility. However, their typically large molecular weight restricts molecular mobility and repositioning under stress, limiting their stretchability performance. In this study, a hydrogel sensor PAM-Gel/β-GP/LiCl (named: PGBL) combining gelatin with ion salts, is proposed. Through the synergistic effect of sodium β-glycerophosphate (β-GP) and LiCl, the PAM-gelatin-based hydrogel achieves an extraordinary elongation strain exceeding 11000 %, enabling ultra-stretchability. Additionally, PGBL exhibits excellent electrical conductivity (8.2 S/m), high sensitivity (GF approximately 4.1), and resilience to low temperatures (−24 °C). Moreover, PGBL demonstrates strong adhesion, making it suitable for skin attachment in human body sensing applications.

"In safety-critical applications of reinforcement learning such as healthcare and robotics, it is often desirable to optimize risk-sensitive objectives that account for tail outcomes rather than expected reward. We prove the first regret bounds for reinforcement learning under a general class of risk-sensitive objectives including the popular CVaR objective. Our theory is based on a novel characterization of the CVaR objective as well as a novel optimistic MDP construction. © 2022 Neural information processing systems foundation. All rights reserved.

"Flexible piezoresistive pressure sensors have attracted much attention for applications in health monitoring and human-machine interfaces due to their simple device structures and easy-to-read signals. For practical applications, the deployment of flexible pressure sensors characterized by high sensitivity and fast response time is imperative for the rapid and accurate detection and monitoring of tiny signals. Such capabilities are essential for facilitating immediate feedback and informed decision-making across a spectrum of contexts. Drawing lessons from the hypersensitive and fast-responding pressure sensing structures in the dragonfly’s neck (for stable imaging during its highly maneuverable flight), a Biomimetic Piezoresistive Pressure Sensor (BPPS) with exquisite mechanically interlocking sensing microstructures is developed. Each interlocking perceptual structure pair consists of an ox-horn-shaped and a mushroom-shaped structural unit. Through the characteristic configuration of the perceptual structure pair, the BPPS realizes a fast gradient accumulation of the contact area, thus synergistically enhancing the sensitivity and fast response capability.","A Hypersensitive, Fast-response Biomimetic Pressure Sensor Inspired by the Superior Sensing Structures of the Dragonfly’s Neck",healthcare robotics,Article,,flexible piezoresistive pressure sensor attracted much attention application health monitoring human machine interface due simple device structure easy read signal practical application deployment flexible pressure sensor characterized high sensitivity fast response time imperative rapid accurate detection monitoring tiny signal capability essential facilitating immediate feedback informed decision making across spectrum context drawing lesson hypersensitive fast responding pressure sensing structure dragonfly neck stable imaging highly maneuverable flight biomimetic piezoresistive pressure sensor bpps exquisite mechanically interlocking sensing microstructures developed interlocking perceptual structure pair consists ox horn shaped mushroom shaped structural unit characteristic configuration perceptual structure pair bpps realizes fast gradient accumulation contact area thus synergistically enhancing sensitivity fast response capability

"Overestimation bias is a long-standing problem in reinforcement learning, often leading to unstable training and suboptimal policies. We present uncertainty-based overestimation correction (UBOC), a framework grounded in order statistics that formally addresses this challenge. UBOC provides a provable generalization of clipped double Q-learning, preserving the same expected Q-value while achieving substantially reduced variance. This reduction in estimator variance improves training stability and, consequently, yields significant gains in sample efficiency. Building upon UBOC, we introduce UD7, which integrates this variance-reduced generalization with state-of-the-art optimization techniques in reinforcement learning. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that UD7 delivers strong early-stage learning efficiency and competitive long-term performance. These findings highlight the suitability of UBOC and UD7 for domains such as robotics, healthcare, and industrial applications, where data collection is risky, costly, or time-consuming. © 2026 Elsevier B.V.

"The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge of interest in research work involving the development of robotic systems that reduce human-to-human interaction, as such a technology can greatly benefit healthcare industries in preventing the spread of highly infectious diseases. An indoor service robot is built and equipped with wheel odometry and a 2D LiDAR. However, the presence of the systematic odometry errors is evident during field testing. Hence, the possibility of minimizing systematic odometry errors is inspected using various methods of calculation, namely: UMBmark, Lee's and Jung's. The methods all use the Bidirectional Square Path test, performed together with ROS. It is found that Jung's method is the most appropriate method showing a 20.4% improvement compared to the uncalibrated dead reckoning accuracy.

"The integration of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare applications holds significant potential for the development of innovative rehabilitation strategies. Great advantage of these new emerging technologies is the possibility to offer a rehabilitation plan that is personalised to each patient, especially in aiding individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this context, a significant challenge is to endow robots with abilities to understand and replicate human social skills during interactions, while concurrently adapting to environmental stimuli. This extended abstract proposes a preliminary robotic architecture capable of estimating the human partner's attention and recognizing the object to which the human is referring. Our work demonstrates how the robot's ability to interpret human social cues, such as gaze, enhances system usability during object referring tasks. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Mobility impairments can prevent older adults from performing their daily activities which highly impacts a person’s quality of life. Exoskeleton technology can assist older adults by providing additional support to compensate for age-related decline in muscle strength. To date little is known about the opinions and needs of older adults regarding exoskeletons as current research primarily focuses on the technical development of exoskeleton devices. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to inform the design of exoskeletons from a human-centered perspective. Interviews were conducted with seven older adults and six healthcare professionals. Results indicated that exoskeletons can be a valuable addition to existing mobility devices. Accepting the need for mobility aids was found to be challenging due to associated stigmas. Therefore, an exoskeleton with a discreet appearance was preferred. Ultimately, the willingness to use exoskeleton technology will depend on personal needs and preferences. © 2018 Copyright is held by the",Potential of exoskeleton technology to assist older adults with daily living,healthcare robotics,Conference paper,,mobility impairment prevent older adult performing daily activity highly impact person quality life exoskeleton technology assist older adult providing additional support compensate age related decline muscle strength date little known opinion need older adult regarding exoskeleton current research primarily focus technical development exoskeleton device therefore aim paper inform design exoskeleton human centered perspective interview conducted seven older adult six healthcare professional result indicated exoskeleton valuable addition existing mobility device accepting need mobility aid found challenging due associated stigma therefore exoskeleton discreet appearance preferred ultimately willingness use exoskeleton technology depend personal need preference copyright held

"Developing robots that can assist humans efficiently, safely, and adaptively is crucial for real-world applications such as healthcare. While previous work often assumes a centralized simulation system for co-optimizing human-robot interactions, we argue that real-world scenarios are much more complicated, as humans have individual preferences regarding how tasks are performed. Robots typically lack direct access to these implicit preferences. However, to provide effective assistance, robots must still be able to recognize and adapt to the individual needs and preferences of different users. To address these challenges, we first delineate the misalignment problem in human and robot observations, then propose a novel framework in which robots infer human intentions and reason about human utilities through interaction. Our approach features two critical modules: the anticipation module is a motion predictor that captures the spatial-temporal relationship between the robot agent and user agent, which contributes to predicting human behavior; the utility module infers",Learning Human-Aware Robot Policies for Adaptive Assistance,healthcare robotics,Article,,developing robot assist human efficiently safely adaptively crucial real world application healthcare previous work often assumes centralized simulation system co optimizing human robot interaction argue real world scenario much complicated human individual preference regarding task performed robot typically lack direct access implicit preference however provide effective assistance robot must still able recognize adapt individual need preference different user address challenge first delineate misalignment problem human robot observation propose novel framework robot infer human intention reason human utility interaction approach feature two critical module anticipation module motion predictor capture spatial temporal relationship robot agent user agent contributes predicting human behavior utility module infers

"Aiming at clinical translation, we developed an automatic 3D imaging system combining the emerging photoacoustic imaging with conventional Doppler ultrasound for detecting inflammatory arthritis. This system was built with a GE HealthCare (GEHC) Vivid™ E95 ultrasound system and a Universal Robot UR3 robotic arm. In this work, the performance of this system was examined with a longitudinal study utilizing a clinically relevant adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) murine model. After adjuvant injection, daily imaging of the rat ankle joints was conducted until joint inflammation was obvious based on visual inspection. Processed imaging results and statistical analyses indicated that both the hyperemia (enhanced blood volume) detected by photoacoustic imaging and the enhanced blood flow detected by Doppler ultrasound reflected the progress of joint inflammation. However, photoacoustic imaging, by leveraging the highly sensitive optical contrast, detected inflammation earlier than Doppler ultrasound, and also showed changes that are more statistically significant.

"In the healthcare industry, nursing robots have made great contributions, assisting in the delivery of food and medicine as well as the movement and transfer of patients. However, the traditional continuum manipulator often has the problems of limited workspace and weak carrying capacity. Compared with traditional manipulator, the continuum manipulator has the advantages of a small moment of inertia and high dexterity. This paper proposes a original cable-driven parallel continuum manipulator with a spherical parallel mechanism as the continuous segments. Due to the spherical parallel mechanisms' characteristics, the proposed cable-driven spherical parallel continuum manipulator offers many inherent advantages for nursing robots.

"Contact pressure sensing and pressure mapping are commonly used in many automotive, healthcare, industrial, and robotics applications. Many commercially available pressure mapping solutions use a dense array of transducers embedded in a pad. However, the pad is relatively thick with noticeable rigid components, and high-resolution pressure mapping systems can be complex, cumbersome, bulky, expensive, and not portable. Thus, the objective of this study was to validate pressure mapping using a commercial Smartfoam interrogated using an electrical impedance tomography (EIT) measurement strategy and algorithm.

"Compared with other industries, automation in the healthcare arena has been slow to evolve. Changes in reimbursement for services provided are forcing hospitals and other healthcare providers to look for more cost effective mechanisms to provide all forms of health related services. Clinical laboratory services are essential to the support of hospital operations and most clinic operations. The current paradigm for clinical laboratory operations is based upon a mix of both batch and random access testing and is highly dependent upon clinical laboratory personnel. Changes in the paradigm for clinical laboratory operations may result in a significant cost savings when fully implemented while maintaining a high level of quality and service for the patients. Several different laboratory organization structures are discussed. The Nebraska automation project is described including the development of a modular conveyor system, the use of automated guided vehicles, software, and network architectures.

"Tactile sensors are essential for robotic systems to safely and effectively interact with the environment and humans. In particular, tri-Axis tactile sensors are crucial for dexterous robotic manipulations by providing shear force, slip, or contact angle information. The soft inductive tactile sensor (SITS) is a new type of tactile sensor that measures inductance variations caused by eddy-current effect. In this paper, we present a soft tri-Axis tactile sensor using the configuration of four planar coils and a single conductive film with a hyperelastic material in between them. The working principle is explained and the design methods are outlined. A 3-D finite-element model was developed to characterize the tri-Axis SITS and to optimize the target design through parameter study. Prototypes were fabricated, characterized, and calibrated, and a force measurement resolution of 0.3 mN is achieved in each axis.

"Bladder cancer is the most common urothelial malignancy. More than 90% arise from the transitional cell lining of the urinary tract. The remainder of the histological variants include squamous cell cancer, adeno carcinoma, and other rare tumours. Urothelial cancer is associated with smoking and exposure to industrial carcinogens. This cancer generally affects people who are older and who have many comorbidities, which makes their management more challenging. More than two-thirds of the urothelial cancers are non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) confined to the mucosa or submucosal layers of the bladder wall and remainder are muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). NMIBC have tendency to recur, and the risk of recurrence varies between 15 and 80% and the majority of the recurrences occur within 6-12 months. Hence, intensive surveillance with cystoscopy and imaging of the urinary tract is required, which in turn incurs a high cost to the healthcare systems.

"The increasing demand for elderly care presents substantial challenges for global healthcare systems, necessitating scalable and adaptive technological solutions. Humanoid robots hold significant potential in assisting elderly users with mobility support, medication management, and social engagement. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by current robotic learning methods, which predominantly rely on scripted or teleoperated behaviors, limiting their adaptability in dynamic caregiving contexts. This conceptual paper introduces a structured Learning from Demonstration (LfD) framework. It leverages Virtual Reality (VR) to capture realistic, embodied demonstrations tailored explicitly for elderly care tasks. We critically discuss key challenges inherent to translating VR-trained behaviors to real-world robot deployment—such as embodiment discrepancies, sensor limitations, and environmental variability—and propose iterative methods to mitigate these issues. This framework explicitly aims to stimulate scholarly discussion, paving the way for subsequent empirical validation and prototyping.

Herein, we present a new strategy for the development of high-performance, flexible capacitive pressure sensors. For this, we optimized the isotropic etching of a silicon mold to obtain inverted dome-type microstructures, and anisotropic etching to obtain a random inverted pyramid microstructure on a silicon mold. In addition to the inverted pyramid silicon mold, we developed a PDMS soft mold with a pyramidal microstructure, which is a replica of the inverted pyramidal silicon mold. For a comparative study, We created two bendy capacitive strain sensors with one electrode in both sensors is attached to a dome-type micro-structured dielectric layer, while the counter electrode in one sensor is attached to the micro-pyramidal dielectric layer, which was",Development of Flexible Capacitive Pressure Sensor with Improved Sensitivity Using Microdome and Micropyramid Polydimethylsiloxane Dielectric Layers,healthcare robotics,Conference paper,,development sensitive flexible capacitive pressure sensor wide application field electronic skin robotics healthcare however remains great challenge develop flexible capacitive pressure sensor high sensitivity herein present new strategy development high performance flexible capacitive pressure sensor optimized isotropic etching silicon mold obtain inverted dome type microstructures anisotropic etching obtain random inverted pyramid microstructure silicon mold addition inverted pyramid silicon mold developed pdms soft mold pyramidal microstructure replica inverted pyramidal silicon mold comparative study created two bendy capacitive strain sensor one electrode sensor attached dome type micro structured dielectric layer counter electrode one sensor attached micro pyramidal dielectric layer

"ABSTRACT: By 2075, neuromodulation and surgical treatments for pain will be heavily impacted by advances in artificial intelligence, regenerative medicine, and precision diagnostics. Digital brain twins will enable patient-specific simulations to optimize intervention selection, while adaptive neuromodulatory systems will provide real-time, responsive pain management. Personalized treatments will replace the current trial-and-error approach, using genetics, neurophysiology, and AI-driven decision tools. Minimally invasive, home-based neuromodulation will increase accessibility, and ethical data governance will enhance patient autonomy. These advances will transform pain from a chronic, partially relieved condition into a precisely treatable disorder, fundamentally improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.By 2075, precision diagnostics will match each pain patient to the optimal neuromodulation or surgical strategy before treatment begins.

"The global COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on the healthcare system, further compounded by the aging population and the staffing shortage. As a result, the demand for healthcare exceeds the available offer, and health professionals are forced to compensate the best they can. On the other hand, some tasks can easily be offloaded to robots. Some solutions already exist, but they are not necessarily scalable, and exhibit a very high price point. This paper outlines our vision of a new distributed robotics approach to mitigate these constraints. We propose a prototype of an autonomous robot to assist healthcare professionals (e.g., nurses) in their work - for instance, by gathering equipment and delivering water and food to give them more time for human-centric tasks. The solution incorporates the ideas of cloud-fog-edge robotics to enable AI-based control with digital twin notions to help with the training.

"Social robots—such as autonomous vehicles, service robots, or healthcare robots—are designed to support tasks in a broad range of human activities. However, these robots face moral dilemmas because they must make decisions that may do good for one human but potentially inflict harm on another. We argue that Kant's categorical imperative provides a framework for algorithm-based moral decision-making. By systematically addressing ethical concerns from the outset in the development of the algorithms that steer social robots, their designers can help ensure that such robots promote the well-being of individuals, communities, and society. We conclude that those involved in the development of social robots need to embed ethics into their design and functioning. The solutions to the ethical dilemmas we advance in this paper can help improve the adoption and impact of social robots.

"Flexible hydrogel-based electronics have gained considerable attention in soft robotics, healthcare management, and electronic skins. However, engineering ionic hydrogel-based sensors capable of simultaneously detecting temperature and humidity is challenging because there is insufficient utilization of dynamic responses of the water matrix within the polymer network to these stimuli. Herein, we present a versatile moisturizing and frost-resistant ionic (MFI) hydrogel that exhibits multimodal sensing of strain, temperature, and humidity. This was achieved by designing a compact hydrogel skeleton that enables precise regulation of water states, such as free and bound water content, through dynamic ion-water interactions. The MFI hydrogel demonstrates impressive mechanical robustness with a toughness of 2.41 MJ m−3 by regulating dynamic crosslinks for efficient energy dissipation. Distinct from its counterparts, the MFI hydrogel-based sensor demonstrates multimodal responsiveness by leveraging hydratable ions to stabilize water molecules. This water-stabilizing strategy enables excellent sensing performance, including a wide response range of 0-1300%,",Design of moisturizing and frost-resistant ionic hydrogels for multimodal sensing through water-stabilizing effects,healthcare robotics,Article,,flexible hydrogel based electronics gained considerable attention soft robotics healthcare management electronic skin however engineering ionic hydrogel based sensor capable simultaneously detecting temperature humidity challenging insufficient utilization dynamic response water matrix within polymer network stimulus herein present versatile moisturizing frost resistant ionic mfi hydrogel exhibit multimodal sensing strain temperature humidity achieved designing compact hydrogel skeleton enables precise regulation water state free bound water content dynamic ion water interaction mfi hydrogel demonstrates impressive mechanical robustness toughness mj regulating dynamic crosslinks efficient energy dissipation distinct counterpart mfi hydrogel based sensor demonstrates multimodal responsiveness leveraging hydratable ion stabilize water molecule water stabilizing strategy enables excellent sensing performance including wide response range

ERCAS-skin has a skin-like binary structure of a carbon nanotube-coated thermoplastic polyurethane nanofibrous scaffold embedded in a gradient cross-linking polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) matrix. The binary structure endows ERCAS-skin with mechanical compliance (Young’s modulus of 2.4 MPa) and crack tolerance (fatigue threshold of 1285 J m–2) through a matrix-to-scaffold stress transfer. The gradient cross-linking PDMS ensures not only high elastic resilience (recovery of 95%) but also strong wet adhesion (0.76 N cm–1) through a synergistic hydrophobic chain mobility effect. The crack generation mechanism of the embedded carbon nanotube polyurethane enables high sensitivity and a wide strain-sensing range.

"Inspired by the mechanism of touch and pain in human skin, we integrated two ion-sensing films and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer together to achieve a bionic artificial receptor with the capacity of distinguishing touch or pain perception through ion-electrical effect. The ion-sensing film provides the carrier of touch or pain perception, while the PDMS layer as a soft substrate is used to regulate the perception ability of receptor. Through a series of experiments, we investigated the effects of physical properties of the PDMS layer on the sensing ability of an artificial receptor. Further, contact area tests were performed in order to distinguish touch or pain under a sharp object. It is revealed that the pressure threshold triggering the touch and pain feedback of the artificial receptor presented an increasing trend when the elastic modulus and thickness of the PDMS substrate increase.

"The present-day healthcare system operates on a 4G network, where the data rate needed for many IoT devices is impossible. Also, the latency involved in the network does not support the use of many devices in the network. The 5G-based cellular technology promises an effective healthcare management system with high speed and low latency. The 5G communication technology will replace the 4G technology to satisfy the increasing demand for high data rates. It incorporates higher frequency bands of around 100 MHz using millimetre waves and broadband modulation schemes. It is aimed at providing low latency while supporting real-time machine-to-machine communication. It requires a more significant number of antennas, with an average base station density three times higher than 4G.

"Accurate and reliable medical image analysis, particularly in lung nodule segmentation, plays a crucial role in data-driven healthcare assistance technologies. Current evaluation metrics for segmentation algorithm performance, however, lack specificity to individual use cases and may not adequately assess the accuracy of 2D segmentation in context. In this preliminary work, we propose a novel evaluation approach that incorporates use case-specific evaluation metrics, focusing particularly on the spatial congruence and mass center accuracy of the nodule segmentation in the context of robot-Assisted image-guided interventions. By simulating predicted segmentation masks using distortion techniques applied to ground truth masks from the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we compute the Dice score and Hausdorff distance, two common metrics for segmentation algorithm evaluation, as well as two proposed metrics, a Mass Center and a Centered Overlap score.

It is possible to evaluate students' attitudes and abilities by seeing and analyzing their behavior in the classroom. Consequently, a great deal of research has used student action recognition to pinpoint student activities. However, most of this study has focused on a specific student behavior, such raising their hands, sleeping, or yawning.

"Wearable devices are revolutionizing smart computing in healthcare. In particular, electroencephalography (EEG) devices (e. g., electrode cap bundles, headbands) are currently enabling many healthcare applications that require real-Time monitoring of brain electrical activity. Examples of those applications include: epilepsy diagnosis, sleep disorder diagnosis, tumor detection, autonomous navigation (e. g., to control wheelchairs), and stress reduction. In many of these applications, the use of clinical-grade EEG devices may not be feasible because of factors such as high cost, privacy concerns, and inconvenience. In this paper, we used the Granger causality test to study whether consumer-grade EEG devices can detect levels of cognitive stress that can reliably be shown to cause changes in vital signs such as blood volume pulse (BVP), electrodermal activity (EDA), and body temperature.

"Analyzing gigapixel images is recognized as computationally demanding. In this paper, we introduce PyramidAI, a technique for analyzing gigapixel images with reduced computational cost. The proposed approach adopts a gradual analysis of the image, beginning with lower resolutions and progressively concentrating on regions of interest for detailed examination at higher resolutions. We evaluated two strategies for balancing accuracy and computational cost in adaptive-resolution selection and validated them on the Camelyon 16 biomedical image dataset. Our results demonstrate that PyramidAI substantially decreases the amount of processed data required for analysis by up to 2.65×, while preserving the accuracy in identifying relevant sections on a single computer.

"Early and accurate detection of brain tumors is crucial for improving clinical outcomes. However, classical MRI-based diagnosis suffers from noise, low contrast, and weak tumor features, posing a challenge to manual and conventional automatic methods. Here, these challenges are addressed by taking into consideration the performance of the YOLOv8 deep learning algorithm, which has been enhanced with strict image preprocessing and data augmentation. With a labeled brain MRI data set, we evaluated four model configurations: (1) raw input, (2) preprocessing only, (3) preprocessing then augmentation, and (4) augmentation then preprocessing. The techniques employed are Gaussian and median blurring, adaptive histogram equalization, morphological operations, and the watershed algorithm, as well as geometric and photometric augmentations.

"Background: Ocular onchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness,” is a parasitic infection caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. Although presentation within the United Kingdom is extremely rare, with no reports evident within the literature, it is the second leading cause of infectious blindness worldwide. Diagnosis is traditionally made through skin snip biopsy, serological testing and, where available, quantitative-polymerase chain reaction. Diagnostic imaging is not traditionally utilised due to limited availability within endemic regions. Case Report: In this case, of a man presenting to a tertiary London ophthalmology unit with recurrent anterior uveitis, both anterior segment ocular examination with paracentesis, demonstrating microfilariae, and fluorodeoxyglucose – positron emission tomography / computed tomography, demonstrating an onchocercoma, play a crucial role in allowing targeted ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration which confirmed the diagnosis.

"Artifacts and noise in low-dose CT images can degrade image quality, potentially hindering accurate diagnosis. In recent years, image-domain post-processing denoising methods have gained flexibility by eliminating the need for raw data. However, clinical scanning conditions vary widely, with most existing studies focusing on CT denoising under fixed or known conditions. Moreover, obtaining paired CT data in clinical settings is challenging, limiting the practical applicability of supervised learning methods. To address these challenges, we propose the self-supervised VQ-SCD, capable of denoising low-dose CT (LDCT) images under varying unknown scanning conditions using only normal-dose CT (NDCT) training data. For the first time, VQ-SCD uses a discretized codebook to approximate the distribution of LDCT features across various scanning conditions, enabling uniform characterization and denoising of data from multiple scanning setups. Additionally, we design a miniature diffusion model that uses up-sampled features as guidance to enhance image details.

"In this paper, we explore various approaches to model the hemodynamic changes during cardiac contraction in the presence of a mitral paravalvular leak. Using computational fluid dynamics and large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, we conducted simulations that represented ventricular motion in four distinct ways. Taking tomography data into account, we developed a heart model that accurately reproduced the actual heart structure. Two simplifications for ventricular geometry to streamline the modeling process were proposed: a static mesh and a universal geometry. The simulation results from the most intricate variant, the CT-based, real model with dynamic mesh, were compared with the outcomes from the simplified approaches, universal geometry and static mesh. The simulations described unsteady flow dynamics during contraction, using a non-Newtonian Carreau-Yasuda blood rheological model.

"Background Four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has evolved into an advanced non-invasive imaging technique that enables comprehensive assessment of blood flow in cardiovascular system. Hemodynamic data from 4D flow MRI provide key biomarkers such as wall shear stress (WSS), turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and viscous energy loss, which aid in the analysis of cardiovascular diseases. However, its clinical application is limited by challenges such as prolonged scan times and limited spatiotemporal resolution. Conventional algorithms have been developed to automate the reconstruction of sparse data and perform image segmentation for hemodynamic quantification, but these methods are often time-consuming and require user expertise for accurate postprocessing.

"Deep learning-based point cloud modeling has been widely investigated as an indispensable component of general shape analysis. Recently, transformer and state space model (SSM) have shown promising capacities in point cloud learning. However, limited research has been conducted on medical point clouds, which have great potential in disease diagnosis and treatment. This paper presents an SSM-based hierarchical feature learning framework for medical point cloud understanding. Specifically, we down-sample the input into multiple levels through the farthest point sampling.

"Modern machine learning models are vulnerable to data poisoning attacks that compromise the integrity of their training data, with label flipping being a particularly insidious variant. In a label flipping attack, an adversary maliciously alters a fraction of the training labels to mislead the model, which can significantly degrade performance or cause targeted misclassifications while often evading simple detection. In this work, we address this threat by introducing a modular, attack-agnostic detection framework (“AI to Protect AI”) that monitors model behaviour for poisoning indicators without requiring internal access or changes to the target model. A Behaviour Monitoring Module (BMM) continuously observes the model’s outputs, extracting telltale features such as prediction probabilities, entropy, and margins for each input. These features are analysed by an ensemble of detector models, including supervised classifiers and unsupervised anomaly detectors, that collaboratively flag suspicious training samples indicative of label tampering.

"Background: Bendopnea is a recognized symptom in patients with systolic heart failure; however, its clinical relevance in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the potential impact of bendopnea on the coexistence of comorbid pulmonary hypertension (PH), various metrics of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), chest CT findings, and respiratory function in a cohort of patients with COPD. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of 133 patients with COPD at Shinshu University Hospital (Matsumoto, Japan). Bendopnea was defined as a positive response to a bendopnea-related question based on the corresponding item in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Pulmonary artery and descending aorta diameters were measured on CT scans. To assess emphysema severity, the percentage of low-attenuation volume (LAV%) was calculated from the same CT scans using specialized image analysis software. Respiratory impedance was evaluated using oscillometry.

"Significance: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging biomedical imaging technology that offers high contrast and high resolution, showing great potential for applications in medical imaging. However, existing regularization methods often lead to instability and artifacts in the reconstruction due to imbalanced regularization parameter settings. To address these issues, we propose a reconstruction algorithm based on the L-alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for PAT, which significantly improves image reconstruction quality and has high clinical application potential. Aim: We introduce a nonconvex L1–L2 norm into the variational model and employ the ADMM to decompose the optimization problem into efficiently solvable subproblems. A preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) method is further integrated to accelerate the solution of linear systems, thereby improving both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency. Approach: We propose an L-ADMM framework with adaptive weighted L1–L2 regularization for PAT reconstruction. The method employs ADMM to split the optimization into tractable subproblems and",Reconstruction algorithm for photoacoustic tomography based on the L-alternating direction method of multipliers model,medical imaging,Article,,significance photoacoustic tomography pat emerging biomedical imaging technology offer high contrast high resolution showing great potential application medical imaging however existing regularization method often lead instability artifact reconstruction due imbalanced regularization parameter setting address issue propose reconstruction algorithm based alternating direction method multiplier admm pat significantly improves image reconstruction quality high clinical application potential aim introduce nonconvex norm variational model employ admm decompose optimization problem efficiently solvable subproblems preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg method integrated accelerate solution linear system thereby improving reconstruction accuracy computational efficiency approach propose admm framework adaptive weighted regularization pat reconstruction method employ admm split optimization tractable subproblems
"Accurate and effective segmentation of retinal fundus vessels images plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis and treatment. However, due to some challenging factors, such as the intricate morphology, low contrast, high background noise, and class imbalance issue of retinal fundus vessels, etc, precise segmentation of retinal fundus vessels remains an exceedingly challenging task. In this paper, a Dual-Direction Attention Fusion Network, abbreviated as DDAF-Net, is presented for the automated segmentation of retinal fundus vessels. To enhance the feature extraction capability of the segmentation network, a dual-encoder block is proposed to obtain stronger feature information. In this case, recurrent convolutions are used in parallel with standard convolution to enable simultaneous extraction of detail information and global contextual information. In addition, to address the problem of loss of detail information caused by multiple pooling operations at the encoder part, a dual-direction skip connection is introduced between the encoder and decoder, to",DDAF-Net: A Dual-Direction Attention Fusion Network for retinal vessel segmentation,medical imaging,Article,,accurate effective segmentation retinal fundus vessel image play pivotal role clinical diagnosis treatment however due challenging factor intricate morphology low contrast high background noise class imbalance issue retinal fundus vessel etc precise segmentation retinal fundus vessel remains exceedingly challenging task paper dual direction attention fusion network abbreviated ddaf net presented automated segmentation retinal fundus vessel enhance feature extraction capability segmentation network dual encoder block proposed obtain stronger feature information case recurrent convolution used parallel standard convolution enable simultaneous extraction detail information global contextual information addition address problem loss detail information caused multiple pooling operation encoder part dual direction skip connection introduced encoder decoder

"Background: Lingual thyroid is a rare congenital anomaly resulting from the aberrant migration of thyroid tissue during embryonic development. Although frequently asymptomatic, its identification in military aircrew poses particular challenges given the rigorous standards of aeromedical certification. Case presentation: A 37-year-old male military helicopter pilot was incidentally diagnosed with lingual thyroid during routine health screening. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout the clinical course. Comprehensive evaluations—including thyroid function tests, biochemical profiling, cervical magnetic resonance imaging, electronic laryngoscopy, radionuclide scanning, and portable sleep monitoring—confirmed the presence of a lingual thyroid with subclinical hypothyroidism. Imaging demonstrated the ectopic tissue at the tongue base to be the sole functioning thyroid gland. Levothyroxine therapy was initiated, resulting in normalization of thyroid hormone levels. Polysomnography was performed due to the anatomical location of the lesion and excluded obstructive sleep apnea or ventilatory compromise.

"Colonoscopy is an effective procedure for the detection and prevention of colorectal cancer. A high-quality colonoscopy reconstruction greatly enhances the ability of clinicians to perform a post-reviews, visualize, and detect subtle lesions and colorectal cancer. However, accurate long-sequence colonoscopy reconstruction faces three major challenges: (1) dissimilarity among segments of the colon due to its meandering and convoluted shape, (2) co-existence of more consistent color distribution and intricately folded geometric structures, and (3) sparse viewpoints due to constrained camera trajectories. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new reconstruction framework based on the neural radiance field, ColonNeRF, for novel view synthesis of long-sequence colonoscopy. Specifically, ColonNeRF introduces a region division and stitching module to reconstruct the entire colon piecewise, overcoming the challenges of shape dissimilarity. To learn both the consistent color distribution and complex geometry in a unified framework, ColonNeRF incorporates a multi-level fusion module that progressively models the colon structure.",ColonNeRF: High-fidelity neural reconstruction of long colonoscopy,medical imaging,Article,,colonoscopy effective procedure detection prevention colorectal cancer high quality colonoscopy reconstruction greatly enhances ability clinician perform post review visualize detect subtle lesion colorectal cancer however accurate long sequence colonoscopy reconstruction face three major challenge dissimilarity among segment colon due meandering convoluted shape co existence consistent color distribution intricately folded geometric structure sparse viewpoint due constrained camera trajectory tackle challenge introduce new reconstruction framework based neural radiance field colonnerf novel view synthesis long sequence colonoscopy specifically colonnerf introduces region division stitching module reconstruct entire colon piecewise overcoming challenge shape dissimilarity learn consistent color distribution complex geometry unified framework colonnerf incorporates multi level fusion module progressively model colon structure

"Elastin plays crucial structural roles in maintaining lung architecture and function while actively participating in disease pathogenesis, particularly in pulmonary fibrosis (PF) and lung cancer. Pathological alteration in the elastin architecture is a key histopathological hallmark of disease progression and presents a promising target for diagnosis. In this study, we developed a class of elastin-targeting molecular imaging probes with a modular design that enables flexible incorporation of wavelength-tunable fluorophores via streamlined one-step conjugation chemistry. Using bleomycin-induced preclinical PF models, we demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo the feasibility of this elastin imaging approach for disease detection, staging, and post-treatment monitoring. The imaging approach was further extended to human nonsmall cell lung cancer samples, where the probes enabled visualization of the fibrotic tumor microenvironment and facilitated the detection of visceral pleural invasion, a critical determinant in lung cancer staging. These findings highlight the potential of the elastin-targeting imaging probes as",Assessment of Pulmonary Fibrosis and Pleural Invasion in Lung Cancer with Elastin-Targeting Molecular Imaging,medical imaging,Article,,elastin play crucial structural role maintaining lung architecture function actively participating disease pathogenesis particularly pulmonary fibrosis pf lung cancer pathological alteration elastin architecture key histopathological hallmark disease progression present promising target diagnosis study developed class elastin targeting molecular imaging probe modular design enables flexible incorporation wavelength tunable fluorophores via streamlined one step conjugation chemistry using bleomycin induced preclinical pf model demonstrated vitro vivo feasibility elastin imaging approach disease detection staging post treatment monitoring imaging approach extended human nonsmall cell lung cancer sample probe enabled visualization fibrotic tumor microenvironment facilitated detection visceral pleural invasion critical determinant lung cancer staging finding highlight potential elastin targeting imaging probe
"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) relies on precise tumor targeting, enabled by the use of fiducial markers. However, conventional marker placement through multiple rigid needle insertions presents risks and may cause tracking errors. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines a flexible ARC needle capable of on-demand curved trajectories with a custom-designed deployment tool. The tool enables the sequential placement of multiple markers through a single entry point with feasibility demonstrated in phantoms and in an ex vivo swine liver under computed tomography (CT) imaging. In addition, we explore the design of new multimodal fiducial markers with distinct radiographic fingerprints, visible in CT, fluoroscopy, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A wide range of candidate materials and configurations were tested in liver-mimicking phantoms and ex vivo tissues to assess visibility and artifact generation.

"Breast Cancer is emerged as the second major cause of death among women. The death rate can be reduced by detecting the cancer at an early stage. Early detection as well as classification of breast cancer makes the treatment very effective. Many deep learning methods are implemented in medical imaging to enhance the accuracy of classification. At the same time, misclassification of breast lesions results in a high false positive rate which diminishes the overall performance. Hence, this article proposes a novel classification method to detect breast cancer by using a Residual radial kernel support vector-based stain bower search algorithm. The main objective of the proposed algorithm is to assist radiologists in identifying anomalies using medical imagining interpretation. The experimental investigations are done on two different dataset via four different phases namely data pre-processing, data augmentation, as well and classification phases.

"Rhabdomyomas are relatively rare, cardiac tumors that are predominantly seen in infancy. Involvement of the mitral valve is considered exceptionally uncommon. We retrospectively reviewed three cases of mitral valve rhabdomyomas in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) at a single institution, focusing on clinical presentation, imaging, and management. All patients presented with low cardiac output and mitral inflow obstruction, resulting in compromised circulatory dynamics. Echocardiography revealed mobile, hyperechoic masses on the mitral leaflets. Despite moments of hemodynamic concerns and fluctuating clinical status, all patients were managed medically with antiarrhythmics, supportive care, and one patient received sirolimus. Tumor regression and symptom improvement were observed with time, indicating a positive long-term prognosis. Neonatal mitral valve rhabdomyomas, though rare, have improved with medical therapy in these cases and surgery was avoided. In select cases, mTOR inhibitors, medical management, and echocardiographic surveillance may offer a safe alternative to surgery. © The Author(s), under exclusive",Rhabdomyomas of the Mitral Valve: Case Series and Conservative Management Approach,medical imaging,Article,,rhabdomyoma relatively rare cardiac tumor predominantly seen infancy involvement mitral valve considered exceptionally uncommon retrospectively reviewed three case mitral valve rhabdomyoma patient tuberous sclerosis complex tsc single institution focusing clinical presentation imaging management patient presented low cardiac output mitral inflow obstruction resulting compromised circulatory dynamic echocardiography revealed mobile hyperechoic mass mitral leaflet despite moment hemodynamic concern fluctuating clinical status patient managed medically antiarrhythmic supportive care one patient received sirolimus tumor regression symptom improvement observed time indicating positive long term prognosis neonatal mitral valve rhabdomyoma though rare improved medical therapy case surgery avoided select case mtor inhibitor medical management echocardiographic surveillance may offer safe alternative surgery author exclusive
"Introduction: Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the pancreas (SCCP) is an extremely rare clinical entity, comprising anywhere between 0.5 to 5% of all pancreatic malignancies, with rising incidence. Pancreatic tissue, normally devoid of squamous cells, must undergo squamous metaplastic changes of its columnar ductal cells, either secondary to inflammation or within a pre-existing adenocarcinoma. Clinical data is poor for SCCP, with diagnostic pathways and treatment options limited, making this area ripe for standardization.

"The lower image contrast of megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT), which corresponds to kilovoltage computed tomography (kVCT), can inhibit accurate dosimetric assessments. This study proposes a deep learning approach, specifically the pix2pix network, to generate high-quality synthetic kVCT (skVCT) images from MVCT data. The model was trained on a dataset of 25 paired patient images and evaluated on a test set of 15 paired images. We performed visual inspections to assess the quality of the generated skVCT images and calculated the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM). Dosimetric equivalence was evaluated by comparing the gamma pass rates of treatment plans derived from skVCT and kVCT images. Results showed that skVCT images exhibited significantly higher quality than MVCT images, with PSNR and SSIM values of 31.9 ± 1.1 dB and 94.8% ± 1.3%, respectively, compared to 26.8 ± 1.7 dB and 89.5% ± 1.5% for MVCT-to-kVCT comparisons.

"Sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) remains a major clinical challenge due to the lack of effective targeted therapies. In this study, we designed ultrasound-responsive, renal-targeted nanoparticles based on serine-modified liposomes co-loaded with the TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 and perfluoropentane (LIPs-S@TAK/PFP). The nanoplatform enables controlled TAK-242 release under low-intensity focused ultrasound through ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction, providing both therapeutic delivery and real-time imaging capability. In vitro studies using HK-2 cells demonstrated that the nanoparticles effectively downregulated TLR4, reduced NF-κB activation, suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and attenuated pyroptosis. In septic rat models, LIPs-S@TAK/PFP significantly improved renal function, as evidenced by reduced serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and cystatin-C levels, while alleviating tubular injury. Histological and molecular analyses further revealed inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptotic markers, including Caspase-1 and GSDMD-N.

"Cancer remains a difficult and complicated medical issue that requires a lot of research. Despite significant progress in understanding its genetic and molecular components, the search for effective treatments is still ongoing. The development of efficient nanocarriers with the ability to target certain cell types is a particularly challenging problem. Research indicates that the unique biochemical characteristics of gadolinium (Gd) complexes inhibit the growth and spread of tumors. Gadolinium (Gd)-based nanomaterials possess distinct paramagnetic, electrical, and physicochemical properties which make them adaptable theranostic platforms. Gd complexes, which were first created as MRI contrast agents, have matured into multifunctional nanosystems with integrated therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities. Recent innovations also encompass Gd-doped inorganic nanostructures, organic-inorganic hybrids, and eco-friendly synthesized nanomaterials that allow for multimodal imaging and combination therapies, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy.

"The number of goblet cells is an important biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of asthma disease. However, visual assessment of a plethora of goblet cells is laborious and time-consuming, making it difficult to precisely identify and count the number of the cells in pathohistological slides. We developed an automated method for identifying goblet cells. It was a combination of coarse and refined recognition, including extraction of the cell region and separation of the adjacent cells. The goblet cell region was extracted with the superpixel method. Initial segmentation results were obtained by merging over-segmented superpixels based on their average intensities in the CIE L*a*b* color space. After that, in refining recognition process, the iCut algorithm was applied to segment touching cells and identify individual goblet cells. The proposed method was evaluated on the images of the lung tissue in a rat model of asthma.

"Early detection and precise segmentation of colorectal polyps are critical for the diagnosis and prevention of colorectal cancer. Traditional approaches relying on hand-crafted low-level features such as color, texture, and shape often fail to capture global contextual information and exhibit limited robustness under complex imaging conditions. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, numerous neural network-based methods have been proposed to improve medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose GSA-MDFNet - a novel architecture that integrates a Graph Structure Attention (GSA) mechanism and a Multi-path Deformable Fusion Module (MDFM) to address the limitations of existing models in accuracy and adaptability to challenging clinical scenarios. The GSA module captures long-range dependencies between image regions and explicitly enhances boundary awareness, while the MDFM employs deformable convolutions and a triple-layer feature fusion strategy to effectively aggregate multi-scale semantic and structural information.

"Multispectral imaging (MSI) captures data across multiple spectral bands, offering enhanced informational depth compared to standard RGB imaging and benefiting diverse fields such as agriculture, medical diagnostics, and industrial inspection. Conventional MSI systems, however, suffer from high cost, complexity, and limited performance in low-light conditions. Moreover, data-driven MSI methods depend heavily on large, labeled training datasets and struggle with generalization. In this work, we present a portable multispectral single-pixel imaging (MS-SPI) method that integrates a chip-sized multispectral detector for system miniaturization and leverages an untrained physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct high-quality spectral images without the need for labeled training data. The physics-informed structure of the network enables the self-corrected reconstruction of multispectral images directly with the input of raw measurements from the multispectral detector. Our proof-of-concept prototype achieves the reconstruction of 12-channel high-quality spectral images at the sampling rate of 10 %.

"The examination of ocular movements, known as gaze analysis, has a wide range of applications due to the current development of sensor technology, which can now collect biometric data. Gaze analysis has succeeded in Human-Computer Interactions (HCI) in recent years. Eye Gaze Trackers (EGTs) are devices that can estimate the direction of a person's gaze, monitoring and recording the movement of the eyes. This work focuses on using eye trackers in the healthcare sector and how they can support doctors, especially radiologists, during their analyses and diagnoses. The proposed framework, FocuGazeDx, uses eye-tracking technology to monitor and analyse doctors' visual attention while they analyse medical images, with the aim of reducing diagnostic errors caused by distraction or fatigue. The final result is the detection of unattended or under-explored regions and the generation of post-observation visual feedback for the doctor.

"Ovarian tumors (OT) are one of the most common tumors in the female reproductive system, and are often classified into two categories: benign and malignant. B-mode ultrasound (BMUS) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) are commonly used as conventional imaging techniques for ovarian tumor screening; however, image interpretation is time-consuming. In this study, we construct a multi-task multi-modal ultrasound image dataset. A multi-task model based on a pre-trained deep learning architecture is trained and applied to predict and select key clinical parameters, as well as to classify benign and ovarian tumors. Finally, blood flow signal, morphology, septation, and solid component are selected as key clinical parameters related to the classification of benign and malignant ovarian tumors. The evaluation metrics for classifying benign and malignant ovarian tumors are as follows: accuracy 0.731, precision 0.692, recall 0.643, and F1-score 0.653.

"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent social communication difficulties, restricted interests, repetitive behaviors, and frequent medical comorbidities. Although early brain development in ASD has been extensively investigated, its biological progression across adulthood and aging remains largely unexplored. Growing evidence suggests that perivascular space (PVS) abnormalities may indicate impaired neurovascular integrity and reduced glymphatic clearance in ASD. Enlarged perivascular spaces (ePVS) in children commonly present alongside increased extra-axial CSF accumulation and more severe clinical manifestations, consistent with early alterations in CSF homeostasis and neuroimmune signaling. However, whether these abnormalities persist or evolve with aging remains unknown. Given that glymphatic and vascular integrity decline with age, and adults with ASD show elevated rates of sleep, metabolic, and cardiovascular disorders, PVS alterations may represent a unifying mechanism linking early neurodevelopmental divergence with later neurovascular vulnerability and cognitive aging. Advances in ultra-high-field MRI and automated segmentation now enable",Autism Spectrum Disorder and Perivascular Spaces: An Integrative Perspective Across the Lifespan,medical imaging,Review,,autism spectrum disorder asd heterogeneous neurodevelopmental condition characterized persistent social communication difficulty restricted interest repetitive behavior frequent medical comorbidities although early brain development asd extensively investigated biological progression across adulthood aging remains largely unexplored growing evidence suggests perivascular space pvs abnormality may indicate impaired neurovascular integrity reduced glymphatic clearance asd enlarged perivascular space epvs child commonly present alongside increased extra axial csf accumulation severe clinical manifestation consistent early alteration csf homeostasis neuroimmune signaling however whether abnormality persist evolve aging remains unknown given glymphatic vascular integrity decline age adult asd show elevated rate sleep metabolic cardiovascular disorder pvs alteration may represent unifying mechanism linking early neurodevelopmental divergence later neurovascular vulnerability cognitive aging advance ultra high field mri automated segmentation enable
"Multichannel imaging within the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window provides rich and diagnostically valuable information for complex surgical environments. However, the development of a high-performance imaging strategy that supports miniaturized, low-crosstalk, and multichannel spectral discrimination remains an unmet challenge. Although dielectric metasurfaces enable subwavelength-scale light manipulation, conventional designs struggle to decouple high-Q multi-resonance control from broadband phase modulation. Herein, we proposed a compact dielectric metasurface doublet to achieve simultaneous high-Q multi-resonance engineering and arbitrary phase profiles. By engineering a multi-resonance nonlocal metasurface composed of coupled cylindrical and annular pillars, we realize three high-Q resonant modes within the NIR-II window, predominantly governed by magnetic dipole (MD), MD, and toroidal dipole (TD) resonances. These modes enable highly selective spectral filtering, offering precise wavelength discrimination. Monolithically integrated on the reverse side, the metalens employs Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) phase modulation to deliver spatial focusing across the three independent channels.

"Anomaly detection aims to model the distribution characteristics of normal data and identify samples that significantly deviate from this distribution. It has been widely applied in real-world scenarios such as industrial defect detection and medical image analysis. Given the limited availability of anomalous samples, zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) has attracted increasing research interest. ZSAD focuses on training models with source-domain data to detect previously unseen anomalies without requiring target-domain samples. Although recent CLIP-based ZSAD approaches have shown promise by leveraging textual prompts or auxiliary data, they still encounter challenges such as substantial performance gaps between image-level and pixel-level tasks and unstable generalization capabilities. To address these limitations, this paper proposes PPR-CLIP, a CLIP-based anomaly detection framework that establishes a unified vision-language feature alignment mechanism by integrating prior knowledge with real-time adaptability. The proposed method effectively exploits latent semantic information from auxiliary data and incorporates textual prompts at both the front-end",Prompting across perception and recognition: A unified CLIP-based visual-text prompt framework for zero-shot anomaly detection,medical imaging,Article,,anomaly detection aim model distribution characteristic normal data identify sample significantly deviate distribution widely applied real world scenario industrial defect detection medical image analysis given limited availability anomalous sample zero shot anomaly detection zsad attracted increasing research interest zsad focus training model source domain data detect previously unseen anomaly without requiring target domain sample although recent clip based zsad approach shown promise leveraging textual prompt auxiliary data still encounter challenge substantial performance gap image level pixel level task unstable generalization capability address limitation paper proposes ppr clip clip based anomaly detection framework establishes unified vision language feature alignment mechanism integrating prior knowledge real time adaptability proposed method effectively exploit latent semantic information auxiliary data incorporates textual prompt front end
"Osilodrostat is an oral steroidogenesis inhibitor used in the treatment of hypercortisolism. It works by inhibiting 11-beta-hydroxylase, a key enzyme in cortisol synthesis. As a consequence of drug action, adrenal insufficiency can be observed in about 40% of patients. Although this effect has been accepted as a consequence of therapy, recent reports suggest adrenal insufficiency can persist even after discontinuation of osilodrostat. We present the case of a 74-year-old female patient who developed prolonged adrenal insufficiency after withdrawal of osilodrostat. The patient was diagnosed with ectopic ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome and underwent radiotherapy for a primary lesion located in the anterior mediastinum. During treatment, osilodrostat was introduced (2 to 4 mg/d), and adrenal insufficiency developed within four weeks. Hydrocortisone (intermittently dexamethasone) replacement therapy was initiated, and over time, undetectable morning cortisol levels continued. After de-escalating the osilodrostat dose, the drug was withdrawn 15 months after initiation.

"In response to the article by Fukui et al. on robotic-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) for neurogenic tumors at the thoracic apex, we offer a critical appraisal emphasizing the risks and overlooked safeguards associated with this approach. While this study highlights the feasibility of preoperative imaging in surgical selection, it reports notably high rates of postoperative neurological complications, including persistent deficits. We argue that advanced imaging modalities, such as three-dimensional CT and omission of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM), merit deeper scrutiny, especially given the proximity to critical neural structures. Additionally, we question the ethical implications of applying aggressive surgical techniques to benign and often asymptomatic lesions. We advocate for a more nuanced, patient-centered approach that balances technical ambition with functional preservation.

"Microscopic video imaging techniques that combine high frame rates with large fields of view (FOV) are essential in applications ranging from biomedical microscopy to industrial inspection. However, simultaneously achieving both high frame rates and large FOVs presents significant challenges. One strategy involves on-chip pixel binning-a process essentially equivalent to downsampling-that boosts the frame rate of area detectors while improving the signal-to-noise ratio in optical imaging. In the context of relay-projection microscopic telescopy (rPMT), a novel computational microscopic imaging technique, pixel binning increases the frame rate but at the cost of enlarging the sampling interval in the Fourier spectrum plane. Since the object plane and the Fourier spectrum plane are linked by Fourier transform, the FOV in the object plane is consequently reduced, potentially failing to cover the entire object, leading to information loss and possible object reconstruction failure. A similar issue may arise when using detectors with inherently large pixel",High frame-rate and large field-of-view relay-projection microscopic telescopy via resampling,medical imaging,Conference paper,,microscopic video imaging technique combine high frame rate large field view fov essential application ranging biomedical microscopy industrial inspection however simultaneously achieving high frame rate large fovs present significant challenge one strategy involves chip pixel binning process essentially equivalent downsampling boost frame rate area detector improving signal noise ratio optical imaging context relay projection microscopic telescopy rpmt novel computational microscopic imaging technique pixel binning increase frame rate cost enlarging sampling interval fourier spectrum plane since object plane fourier spectrum plane linked fourier transform fov object plane consequently reduced potentially failing cover entire object leading information loss possible object reconstruction failure similar issue may arise using detector inherently large pixel

"Lipodystrophy is a rare group of metabolic disorders characterized by the abnormal distribution of body fat, which can lead to various metabolic complications due to the body’s inability to adequately process carbohydrates and fat. We report the case of a female, aged 53 years, who was admitted as an outpatient for progressive weight loss of the upper part of the body (face, neck, arms, and chest), dyspeptic complaints, fatigue, mild insomnia, and anxious behavior. Her medical history was characterized by the presence of dyslipidemia, hypertension, and a minor stroke episode. However, she denied any family-relevant medical history. Although the clinical perspective suggested a possible late onset of partial acquired lipodystrophy, due to the imaging exam that revealed an enlarged liver with inhomogeneous structure with multiple nodular lesions, scattered over both lobes, a lot of lab work-ups and complementary studies were performed.

"Laminar Optical Tomography (LOT) integrates diffuse optical tomography with microscopy to provide high-resolution, depth-resolved imaging capable of acquiring three-dimensional structural and functional information without depth scanning. Nevertheless, its imaging depth is inherently constrained by the rapid divergence of the incident Gaussian beam beyond the focal plane. Bessel beams, distinguished by their non-diffracting and self-healing properties, offer an alternative illumination strategy that can mitigate this limitation. In this study, we compared Bessel-beam LOT with conventional Gaussian-beam LOT by assessing the lateral spot size along the optical axis through angular-spectrum simulations, subsequently validating the simulated beam profiles experimentally. Simulations indicated that Gaussian beams afford a depth of focus of 50 μm, whereas Bessel beams preserve comparable lateral resolution over 2 mm. Beam-profiler measurements further revealed that at 1 mm beyond the focal plane the Gaussian beam's spot diameter broadens to 817 % of its focal value, whereas the Bessel beam expands to",Bessel beam based laminar optical tomography system,medical imaging,Conference paper,,laminar optical tomography lot integrates diffuse optical tomography microscopy provide high resolution depth resolved imaging capable acquiring three dimensional structural functional information without depth scanning nevertheless imaging depth inherently constrained rapid divergence incident gaussian beam beyond focal plane bessel beam distinguished non diffracting self healing property offer alternative illumination strategy mitigate limitation study compared bessel beam lot conventional gaussian beam lot assessing lateral spot size along optical axis angular spectrum simulation subsequently validating simulated beam profile experimentally simulation indicated gaussian beam afford depth focus whereas bessel beam preserve comparable lateral resolution mm beam profiler measurement revealed mm beyond focal plane gaussian beam spot diameter broadens focal value whereas bessel beam expands

"The recombinant herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine, Shingrix®, faces challenges such as high reactogenicity and manufacturing complexities of AS01 adjuvant, highlighting the need for safe and effective alternatives. In this study, we developed and evaluated four emulsion-based adjuvant systems (ZMF59/QS-21, ZAS03/QS-21, ZMF59/CpG, and ZAS03/CpG) for HZ vaccines in a varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-primed mouse model. Mechanistic studies were conducted at the molecular, cellular, and tissue levels using fluorescence imaging, flow cytometry, and Luminex assays. We found that although ZAS03 alone elicited higher antibody titers than ZMF59, ZMF59/QS-21 was superior to ZAS03/QS-21, and ZMF59/CpG also tended to elicit higher responses than ZAS03/CpG. Notably, ZMF59/CpG induced robust humoral and cellular immune responses comparable to the AS01-like adjuvant, while avoiding safety concerns related to excessive immune activation in emulsion-based QS-21 formulations. Synergy analysis indicated that these enhancements of ZMF59/CpG were driven predominantly by additive and complementary effects, with synergy restricted to some long-term adaptive indicators.",Design and mechanistic insights into ZMF59/CpG: a complementary adjuvant system boosting immunity and safety in herpes zoster vaccines,medical imaging,Article,,recombinant herpes zoster hz vaccine shingrix face challenge high reactogenicity manufacturing complexity adjuvant highlighting need safe effective alternative study developed evaluated four emulsion based adjuvant system zmf q zas q zmf cpg zas cpg hz vaccine varicella zoster virus vzv primed mouse model mechanistic study conducted molecular cellular tissue level using fluorescence imaging flow cytometry luminex assay found although zas alone elicited higher antibody titer zmf zmf q superior zas q zmf cpg also tended elicit higher response zas cpg notably zmf cpg induced robust humoral cellular immune response comparable like adjuvant avoiding safety concern related excessive immune activation emulsion based q formulation synergy analysis indicated enhancement zmf cpg driven predominantly additive complementary effect synergy restricted long term adaptive indicator
"This study presents a novel Feature Pyramid Network with Dual-Decoder Supervision for accurate stroke lesion localization in multi-modal brain MRI. The proposed architecture integrates a Swin Transformer backbone with multi-scale feature aggregation, enabling effective fusion of hierarchical representations from DWI, ADC, and FLAIR sequences. A dual-decoder structure is employed, where the auxiliary decoder provides coarse lesion guidance through pseudo masks, and the primary decoder refines boundaries for precise voxel-level segmentation. Auxiliary supervision improves convergence stability and feature discrimination, while modality dropout enhances robustness to incomplete imaging protocols. Experiments conducted on the ATLAS v2.0 dataset demonstrate superior performance over baseline encoder–decoder models, achieving higher Dice scores, improved boundary accuracy, and strong lesion-wise detection rates. The model consistently localizes lesions of varying size, shape, and intensity, with minimal overfitting, as evidenced by small training–testing performance gaps. Qualitative results confirm the framework’s ability to transform coarse localization into anatomically accurate predictions.

"Breast cancer remains the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide, emphasizing the demand for accessible and accurate screening technologies. Infrared thermography offers a noninvasive and radiation-free alternative; however, automated segmentation remains challenging due to low contrast, noise, and high intersubject variability. Existing approaches—from classical computer-vision pipelines to advanced deep networks such as UNet, SegNet, YOLOv8-Seg, TransUNet, and Dense Multiscale UNet—often depend on large annotated datasets and lack anatomical constraints, leading to unstable boundaries and inconsistent thermal quantification. We propose a hybrid UNet that integrates thermographic anatomical landmarks as spatial priors, combined with targeted geometric and spectral augmentation to enhance robustness to variations in anatomy, sensor calibration, and acquisition protocols. This design enforces anatomically plausible breast contours and minimizes dependence on extensive manual labeling. Validated on an independent held-out test set with bootstrap-based confidence estimation, the proposed model achieved DSC = 0.988 0.004, IoU = 0.958 0.006, AUC = 0.995 0.003,",Anatomy-guided breast segmentation in thermograms using a multiscale UNet hybrid framework,medical imaging,Article,,breast cancer remains prevalent cancer among woman worldwide emphasizing demand accessible accurate screening technology infrared thermography offer noninvasive radiation free alternative however automated segmentation remains challenging due low contrast noise high intersubject variability existing approach classical computer vision pipeline advanced deep network unet segnet yolov seg transunet dense multiscale unet often depend large annotated datasets lack anatomical constraint leading unstable boundary inconsistent thermal quantification propose hybrid unet integrates thermographic anatomical landmark spatial prior combined targeted geometric spectral augmentation enhance robustness variation anatomy sensor calibration acquisition protocol design enforces anatomically plausible breast contour minimizes dependence extensive manual labeling validated independent held test set bootstrap based confidence estimation proposed model achieved dsc iou auc

"In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated their effectiveness in medical imaging by generating high-quality data through the incremental addition and reversal of Gaussian noise. Previous studies have successfully employed these models for accelerated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction, which has enhanced patient experiences by reducing scan times. In this paper, we introduce a novel model called the Adaptive-Multiscale K-space Cold Diffusion Network (AMK-CDiffNet), specifically designed for MRI reconstruction. Unlike traditional models that rely on Gaussian noise, our approach utilizes undersampling techniques to create a mask and progressively decrease the sampling rate, capitalizing on the frequency characteristics of K-space. We implement frequency-domain degradation during forward diffusion and frequency-domain complementation during backward diffusion to improve reconstruction quality. The network structure consists of two specific modules: the K-space Adaptive Dilated Convolution Block (KADCB) and the Frequency-Domain Manipulation Module (FDMM). The KADCB is designed to mask and weigh frequencies, enabling the model to",AMK-CDiffNet: Adaptive-multiscale K-space cold diffusion network for fast MRI reconstruction,medical imaging,Article,,recent year diffusion model demonstrated effectiveness medical imaging generating high quality data incremental addition reversal gaussian noise previous study successfully employed model accelerated magnetic resonance imaging mri reconstruction enhanced patient experience reducing scan time paper introduce novel model called adaptive multiscale space cold diffusion network amk cdiffnet specifically designed mri reconstruction unlike traditional model rely gaussian noise approach utilizes undersampling technique create mask progressively decrease sampling rate capitalizing frequency characteristic space implement frequency domain degradation forward diffusion frequency domain complementation backward diffusion improve reconstruction quality network structure consists two specific module space adaptive dilated convolution block kadcb frequency domain manipulation module fdmm kadcb designed mask weigh frequency enabling model

"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. It is a disease in which abnormal breast cells multiply uncontrollably, forming tumors. These tumors can spread throughout the body, leading to serious and potentially fatal complications. Early detection of breast cancer makes treatment more effective and increases the chances of recovery. Artificial intelligence plays a crucial role in disease diagnosis, particularly in breast cancer detection. The data collected can be used by machine learning to create predictive models for breast cancer. However, not all of the collected data is relevant, which brings us to the concept of dimensionality reduction. In this work, we propose a technique based on autoencoders to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, thereby improving the performance of machine learning classifiers. We train an autoencoder and use only the “encoder” part, which outputs the latent space where the most relevant features are concentrated.

"Recently, deep learning continues to make significant advances in medical image segmentation. But most of these achieved results are based on the simple scenario assumption that the source and target domains are equally distributed. However, this assumption is unrealistic, and deploying existing methods directly into clinical applications can lead to significant performance degradation. Existing means of addressing distributional bias include data augmentation, meta-learning, etc. However, these methods did not separate and address the similarities and differences between data domains, thus limiting the generalization performance of the models. In order to mitigate mutual interference between the similarities and differences among the data during the processing. We adopted a more advanced approach using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to separate the similarity (phase) and difference (amplitude) components of the data. Subsequently, we processed the amplitudes separately using our proposed amplitude alignment network, which directly aligns the amplitude distributions across all domains within the",DGAA: Domain Generalization with Amplitude Alignment,medical imaging,Article,,recently deep learning continues make significant advance medical image segmentation achieved result based simple scenario assumption source target domain equally distributed however assumption unrealistic deploying existing method directly clinical application lead significant performance degradation existing mean addressing distributional bias include data augmentation meta learning etc however method separate address similarity difference data domain thus limiting generalization performance model order mitigate mutual interference similarity difference among data processing adopted advanced approach using fast fourier transform fft separate similarity phase difference amplitude component data subsequently processed amplitude separately using proposed amplitude alignment network directly aligns amplitude distribution across domain within
"Accurate segmentation of the optic nerve and surrounding structures in transorbital ultrasound (TOS) imaging is essential for non-invasive assessment of elevated intracranial pressure and other neuro-ophthalmic conditions. However, inherent low contrast, speckle noise, and ambiguous anatomical boundaries in ultrasound images pose significant challenges. In this work, we propose UncEGA-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed to robustly segment the optic nerve (ON) and optic nerve sheath (ONS) from TOS images. The backbone employs a ConvNeXtV2-Tiny encoder to extract high-level semantic features while maintaining computational efficiency. Most importantly, we introduce the EGA-U module (Edge-Guided Attention with Uncertainty), which exploits a Bernoulli-based proxy approximation to predict uncertainty, thus dynamically regulating the inverse attention and enhance the feature representation near the uncertainty boundary.

"Introduction: Vision-Based Tracking (VBT) enhances Electromagnetic Tracking (EMT) by addressing Computer CT-to-body divergence. Current VBT methods use depth map-based point clouds to register the bronchoscope in Computer Tomography (CT) scans; however, similarities in airway geometry often lead to registration ambiguities. This paper introduces a Direct Pose Estimation (DPE) method for VBT that bypasses depth maps to localize the bronchoscope in CT scans, validated with human-derived lung phantoms. Methods: We developed a self-supervised DPE (SS-DPE) method for bronchoscopy by introducing a module to mask corrupt pixels and adding pose consistency and long-term consistency losses. We also propose a technique to adjust pose predictions closer to airway centerlines to mitigate drift.

"In deep learning, the robustness and generalizability of models significantly depend on diverse and heterogeneous training data. Acquiring such an extensive dataset is challenging in fields like disorder prediction due to data scarcity, which can be attributed to factors such as privacy concerns, limited patient population, or inadequate facilities. Data augmentation can be an ideal solution to this problem, particularly in the field of disorder prediction, like autism, using medical imaging. Data augmentation can expand and balance datasets by generating high-quality and varied data, thereby improving the generalizability of deep learning models. This study proposed two types of augmentation methods: 1. Spatial level 2. Intensity level augmentation techniques. Eight different levels of augmentations were experimented with across these categories. This study found that the combination of spatial and intensity level augmentations enhanced the model's generalizability and robustness, achieving an AUC value of 0.7433.

"Kidney cancer is one of the top ten cancers in the world. Early detection of renal tumors can significantly improve patient survival rates. Automatic segmentation of kidneys and renal lesions from CT images is crucial for the treatment of renal cancer. However, due to the irregular and uneven distribution of renal tumor growth, diverse physiological morphologies, and the extreme difficulty in detecting small tumors, achieving complete detection of tumors remains challenging.Therefore, this paper proposes an unsupervised kidney and renal tumor segmentation network that integrates image enhancement and transfer-based restoration mechanisms.

"Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is a powerful tool in medical diagnosis, but its lengthy acquisition process can lead to patient discomfort. Recently, undersampling reconstruction techniques have gained popularity for accelerating multi-contrast MR images, with two critical components emerging: designing effective k-space undersampling patterns and developing advanced undersampling reconstruction networks. However, traditional sampling patterns lack a dynamic link to the reconstruction process. This study addresses this by implementing a joint optimization framework for multi-contrast MR image sampling patterns and using a Swin Transformer and Unet (Swin-Unet) to improve reconstruction. Firstly, we design differentiable probability matrices for multiple sampling masks to overcome the non-differentiability issue in traditional sampling patterns. Through the joint optimization strategy, shared structural information across multi-contrast images is leveraged to design specialized sampling patterns for MR images with different contrasts. Then, the Swin-Unet with variable mask data consistency (VMDC) layer leverages its capabilities to represent long-distance and local dependencies,",Multi-contrast magnetic resonance image reconstruction joint with one-dimensional or two-dimensional sampling patterns optimization,medical imaging,Article,,magnetic resonance mr imaging powerful tool medical diagnosis lengthy acquisition process lead patient discomfort recently undersampling reconstruction technique gained popularity accelerating multi contrast mr image two critical component emerging designing effective space undersampling pattern developing advanced undersampling reconstruction network however traditional sampling pattern lack dynamic link reconstruction process study address implementing joint optimization framework multi contrast mr image sampling pattern using swin transformer unet swin unet improve reconstruction firstly design differentiable probability matrix multiple sampling mask overcome non differentiability issue traditional sampling pattern joint optimization strategy shared structural information across multi contrast image leveraged design specialized sampling pattern mr image different contrast swin unet variable mask data consistency vmdc layer leverage capability represent long distance local dependency

"This study investigates the efficacy of gallium as a contrast agent for enhancing X-ray phototherapy in breast cancer tumors using the MCNPX code. A tumor was simulated within the breast section of the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) phantom and irradiated with a 100 keV X-ray source. Gallium concentrations ranging from 1 % to 9 % (by weight) were introduced into the tumor volume to evaluate the enhancement of the deposited dose. Additionally, the reduction in scattered dose to nearby critical organs was assessed. The results indicate that increasing the gallium concentration significantly enhances the dose deposited in the tumor, reaching a saturation effect at higher percentages. Critically, the presence of 9 % gallium reduced the scattered dose to surrounding organs by a range of 62 %–93 %. This study demonstrates the potential of gallium-enhanced radiotherapy to simultaneously increase tumor dose while substantially protecting surrounding healthy tissues, thereby improving the",Evaluation of gallium as a contrast agent in breast X-ray phototherapy using Monte Carlo simulations,medical imaging,Article,,study investigates efficacy gallium contrast agent enhancing ray phototherapy breast cancer tumor using mcnpx code tumor simulated within breast section medical internal radiation dose mird phantom irradiated kev ray source gallium concentration ranging weight introduced tumor volume evaluate enhancement deposited dose additionally reduction scattered dose nearby critical organ assessed result indicate increasing gallium concentration significantly enhances dose deposited tumor reaching saturation effect higher percentage critically presence gallium reduced scattered dose surrounding organ range study demonstrates potential gallium enhanced radiotherapy simultaneously increase tumor dose substantially protecting surrounding healthy tissue thereby improving
"Microscope image analysis remains a fundamental method for characterizing particle morphology and their agglomeration in aerosol research. However, existing techniques often focus on fractal-like agglomerates, such as diesel soot, but non-fractal, polydisperse agglomerates are insufficiently addressed in automated image analysis. This study presents an automated image analysis method for detecting and analyzing non-fractal aerosol particle agglomerates from images obtained using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The approach integrates classical computer vision techniques, including edge detection and the Hough Circle Transform, to identify spherical primary particles across a wide size distribution, ranging from several nm to hundred microns. Subsequently, the method identifies inter-particle connections to group the primary particles into individual agglomerates. The method determines primary particle and agglomerate size distributions, and equivalent diameters of primary particles and agglomerates. Structural differences were observed between smaller, uniform-size type agglomerates and larger, collector-type agglomerates. The method was validated using fly ash particles from",Automated image analysis for detection and quantitative characterization of aerosol particle agglomerates,medical imaging,Article,,microscope image analysis remains fundamental method characterizing particle morphology agglomeration aerosol research however existing technique often focus fractal like agglomerate diesel soot non fractal polydisperse agglomerate insufficiently addressed automated image analysis study present automated image analysis method detecting analyzing non fractal aerosol particle agglomerate image obtained using scanning electron microscope sem approach integrates classical computer vision technique including edge detection hough circle transform identify spherical primary particle across wide size distribution ranging several nm hundred micron subsequently method identifies inter particle connection group primary particle individual agglomerate method determines primary particle agglomerate size distribution equivalent diameter primary particle agglomerate structural difference observed smaller uniform size type agglomerate larger collector type agglomerate method validated using fly ash particle

"Accurate clinical diagnosis requires comprehensive analysis of medical imaging and patient narratives. However, current computer-aided diagnosis methods focus primarily on imaging modalities while neglecting the integration of patient-reported clinical narratives, due to the scarcity of high-quality patient narratives and the limitations in multimodal information fusion. To address these issues, we propose a dual-component framework consisting of: 1) a Retrieval Augmented Patient Narratives Generation Module (RANGM) that employs a retrieval-enhanced mechanism to guide pre-trained large language models in generating clinically plausible patient narratives; and 2) a Multimodal Information Balanced Fusion Network (MIBF-Net) incorporating our novel Information Balanced Fusion Attention (IBFA) module for effective cross-modal integration, along with a Modal Prediction-Divergent Loss (MP-Loss) to enhance the model’s ability to diagnose samples that have ambiguous single modal prediction distribution.

"The segmentation of brain tumors is one of the most extensively discussed challenges in medical image processing, aiming to differentiate various tumor regions from background regions in MRI scans. While UNet and its variants have demonstrated exceptional performance in 2D and 3D image segmentation, existing methods often neglect the temporal sequence associations between brain tumor MRI slices, which contain crucial information about lesion characteristics. To address this limitation, we propose the SF-SSM UNet (Sequential Flow State Space Model UNet), featuring the Sequential Flow Selective Scanning Module Group (SF-SSM Group). Our approach transcends traditional 2D and 3D models by treating MRI brain tumor slices as serialized image flow inputs. In the SF-SSM UNet, sequence flow is constructed through feature dimensional rearrangement, and Mamba SSM is applied across both sequence and channel dimensions, enabling the model to effectively capture temporal dependencies and feature interactions between slices.

"Near-infrared (NIR) mechanoluminescent materials are attracting significant attention due to their potential applications in biomedical imaging, food analysis, and night vision. In this study, Tb<inf>3</inf>Al<inf>5</inf>O<inf>12</inf>:Cr3+(TAG:Cr3+) phosphors were successfully synthesized using a conventional high-temperature solid-state method. These materials demonstrated enhanced NIR luminescence through energy transfer (ET) between Tb3+ and Cr3+. The structural and luminescent properties of the TAG:Cr3+ phosphors were systematically investigated, revealing a strong spectral overlap between the emission of Tb3+ and the excitation of Cr3+, which facilitates efficient ET. When embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) composites, the phosphors exhibited notable mechanoluminescence (ML) properties, showing robust response and recoverability under repeated mechanical stimulation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidated the luminescence mechanism at the atomic scale, highlighting charge transfer interactions between the TAG:Cr3+ phosphors and the PDMS matrix.

"Background: Peptide-based therapeutics for melanoma have received increasing attention in medical research. However, the local delivery of such therapeutics poses unique challenges.

"Interactive segmentation tools, such as SAM2, have shown strong performance in reducing annotation effort in natural images. However, unlike natural images, ultrasound images and videos often lack well-defined structure boundaries, which significantly degrade the performance of region-based point prompts in SAM models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Segment Anything Model 2 for UltraSound Annotation (SAMUSA). SAMUSA is based on SAM2 and introduces a new prompt strategy with boundary and temporal points, along with a novel boundary loss function, enabling the model to more efficiently segment structures with poorly defined boundaries, such as liver masses. We integrated SAMUSA as a 3D Slicer plugin, where it can be used for US videos and 3D US volumes segmentation.

"Multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) translation leverages information from source MRI sequences to generate target modalities, enabling comprehensive diagnosis while overcoming the limitations of acquiring all sequences. While existing deep-learning-based multi-modal MRI translation methods have shown promising potential, they still face two key challenges: 1) lack of reliable uncertainty quantification for synthesized images, and 2) limited robustness when deployed across different medical centers. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that reformulates multi-modal MRI translation as a multi-modal evidential regression problem with distribution calibration. Our approach incorporates two key components: 1) an evidential regression module that estimates uncertainties from different source modalities and an explicit distribution mixture strategy for transparent multi-modal fusion, and 2) a distribution calibration mechanism that adapts to source-target mapping shifts to ensure consistent performance across different medical centers.

"Blood biomarkers have emerged as accurate tools for detecting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, offering a minimally invasive alternative to traditional diagnostic methods such as imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Yet, the logistics surrounding venipuncture for blood collection, although considerably simpler than the acquisition of imaging and CSF, require precise processing and storage specific to AD biomarkers that are still guided by medical personnel. Consequently, limitations in their widescale use in research and broader clinical implementation exist.

"In clinical diagnosis, doctors usually judge the information by a few X-rays to avoid excessive ionizing radiation from harming the patient. The recent Neural Radiance Field (NERF) technology contemplates generating novel-views from a single X-ray to assist physicians in diagnosis. In this task, we consider two advantages of X-ray filming over natural images: (1) The medical equipment is fixed, and there is a standardized filming pose. (2) There is an apparent structural prior to X-rays of the same body part at the same pose. Based on such conditions, we propose a Pose-Guided generative radiance field (PGgraf) containing a generator and discriminator. In the training phase, the discriminator combines the image features with two kinds of pose information (ray direction set and camera angle) to guide the generator to synthesize X-rays consistent with the realistic view.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the common forms of dementia and is tremendously increasing throughout the world. There are many biomarkers currently available to detect the AD progression. In AD, brain cell death occurs, leading to memory loss, impaired calculation ability, and difficulty in remembering recent events.

"Significance: Confocal endomicroscopic image stitching can expand the field of view and improve examination efficiency. However, due to interference from the rolling shutter effect, traditional stitching methods may produce misalignments, leading to structural distortion and artifacts.

The parallel dual-encoder paths of DGU-Net extract Gaussian features and conventional features at different resolutions, respectively, achieving more precise gland segmentation masks. Based on these masks, we filter stable frames and optimize feature matching to effectively suppress rolling shutter interference and improve stitching quality.

"In the highly intertwined field of healthcare, cross-modal medical data (including diagnostic imaging profiles, physiological time series signals, clinical voice archives, electronic medical records, surgical video streams, and genomics data) play a key role in clinical diagnostic and treatment decisions and basic medical research. Despite the breakthroughs in medical knowledge management and information processing made by generalized Large Language Models (LLMs), the existing systems are mainly limited to the processing capability of text modality, and this unimodal limitation seriously restricts the practical application value of intelligent medical systems. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can realize multidimensional patient feature modeling through the deep semantic fusion of multimodal medical data, which can significantly improve the efficiency of disease identification and medical resource scheduling, and support the formulation of precise individual treatment strategies.

"Uterine disorders, such as adenomyosis and fibroids, are major contributors to pelvic pain, abnormal uterine bleeding, and infertility. Morphologic configurations and geometric alterations of the uterine cavity serve as critical imaging biomarkers in clinical diagnosis. One well established example is the question mark sign, a highly specific indicator of adenomyosis, characterized by distinctive uterine contour distortions. However, beyond this singular marker, a broader range of shape variations may hold diagnostic significance. To systematically capture these morphologic and geometric patterns, we adapted a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) pre-trained on fastMRI datasets. Instead of encoding MRI images alone, we designed the model to jointly incorporate both the segmented uterine cavity and MRI scans. By embedding an anatomy-informed prior, the model is better equipped to characterize structural anatomy relevant to uterine pathology. Our results indicate that both fine-tuning the VAE and using the hybrid encoding approach produce embeddings that align more closely with clinically","UteroVAE: A Shape-Informed Variational Autoencoder for Uterine MRI Encoding in Adenomyosis, Fibroids, and Healthy Uteri",medical imaging,Conference paper,,uterine disorder adenomyosis fibroid major contributor pelvic pain abnormal uterine bleeding infertility morphologic configuration geometric alteration uterine cavity serve critical imaging biomarkers clinical diagnosis one well established example question mark sign highly specific indicator adenomyosis characterized distinctive uterine contour distortion however beyond singular marker broader range shape variation may hold diagnostic significance systematically capture morphologic geometric pattern adapted variational autoencoder vae pre trained fastmri datasets instead encoding mri image alone designed model jointly incorporate segmented uterine cavity mri scan embedding anatomy informed prior model better equipped characterize structural anatomy relevant uterine pathology result indicate fine tuning vae using hybrid encoding approach produce embeddings align closely clinically

"Medical clinic location selection critically impacts long-term profitability, yet physicians often lack data-driven decision-making tools for this strategic choice. This research addresses key challenges in healthcare facility planning: the scarcity of revenue prediction data and limited understanding of location-revenue relationships specific to medical clinics. We propose an innovative framework utilizing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to extract latent regional characteristics from satellite imagery, enabling effective revenue prediction despite small sample constraints. Our methodology integrates municipal-level demographic data with latent LMM-estimated features, capturing both explicit metrics and implicit characteristics that conventional methods overlook. Experiments across multiple clinic types and location conditions demonstrated that incorporating latent LMM-estimated features consistently improved prediction performance, with average improvements of 8.3% for mean squared error (MSE) and 31.6% for coefficient of determination (R2) compared to demographic-only approaches. The extracted interpretable features provide concrete decision-making criteria for practitioners.

"Pathologic complete response (pCR) prediction for breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies. Nowadays, an increasing number of studies focus on predicting NAC response using preoperative imaging, and with the advancement of deep learning, different modalities of imaging and other clinical data can be effectively integrated to provide more comprehensive information. However, existing deep learning methods primarily focus on multimodal fusion or longitudinal modeling but often suffer from inadequate feature focus and overlook specific treatment effects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal-learning framework LMF(Longitudinal MRI-Clinical Multimodal Fusion) that enhances feature extraction and explicitly models treatment-induced imaging changes. Our method consists of two key components: (1) Molecular-Aware Deformable Attention (MADA), which integrates molecular subtype information with MRI features and refines spatial representations via deformable cross-attention mechanism; and (2) Treatment-Aware Longitudinal Modeling (TALM), which incorporates treatment embeddings to capture NAC-driven feature variations.

"Nanovision static computed tomography (CT), a novel system with a multisource X-ray array and tiled miniature detectors, promises unprecedented temporal resolution but introduces significant geometric calibration challenges due to its high-dimensional parameter space and the difficulty of constraining individual detector poses. Existing approaches rely on strong assumptions, such as high-precision phantoms and ideal circular scanning trajectories, which limit their applicability in practical engineering scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a robust, local-to-global framework to solve this nonconvex optimization problem. The method first leverages manufacturing priors to perform a local optimization of the overall source and detector ring geometry. It then proceeds to a global stage, using an alternating optimization algorithm to precisely refine the parameters of each small detector. Experiments conducted on both simulation and clinical datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves calibration accuracy and subsequent image reconstruction quality.

"The availability of data from different sources or modalities had empowered the capabilities for analysis of different complex phenomena. However, there are several inherent issues to develop a joint analysis of several modalities such as time and spatial synchronization of the data. I this paper, we propose a method for the joint analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings measured simultaneously. The method considers fusion of features extracted from the data and fusion of the classification results from several methods. Several single classifiers were implemented, which results were fused using average fusion and alpha integration, an advanced fusion method. This later ensures optimality from the point of view of least mean-square error. The results show the capabilities of the fusion to improve the results of single classifiers and possible clinical meaning of the results. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2026.",Multimodal Analysis of Neuropsychological Tests from EEG and fMRI Data,medical imaging,Conference paper,,availability data different source modality empowered capability analysis different complex phenomenon however several inherent issue develop joint analysis several modality time spatial synchronization data paper propose method joint analysis functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri electroencephalography eeg recording measured simultaneously method considers fusion feature extracted data fusion classification result several method several single classifier implemented result fused using average fusion alpha integration advanced fusion method later ensures optimality point view least mean square error result show capability fusion improve result single classifier possible clinical meaning result author exclusive license springer nature switzerland ag

"Abstract: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women globally, and its early detection is essential for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. Traditional diagnostic approaches often rely on imaging and statistical analysis techniques, which may not effectively capture complex relationships within clinical data. This study introduces a novel deep learning framework utilizing graph neural networks (GNNs) for breast cancer classification. The proposed model transforms structured data into a graph format, allowing for the representation of inter-feature dependencies through message-passing mechanisms. A weighted K-nearest neighbors algorithm is used to construct the graph, followed by a graph embedding process that encodes both local and global feature relationships. A two-layer graph convolutional network is employed to perform node-level classification, distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. The computational demands of graph construction, embedding, and hyperparameter optimization necessitated the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources.

"Early skin disease detection significantly improves patient survival rates, yet limited access to dermatological expertise creates an urgent need for automated diagnostic systems. In this paper, we develop a dual-branch deep learning framework that simultaneously performs skin lesion segmentation and classification from dermoscopic images. The proposed segmentation branch uses a modified EfficientNet-B7 encoder with Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) for multi-scale feature extraction and transformer blocks for global context modeling. Attention gates and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks enhance feature selection and boundary precision. The classification branch fuses DenseNet-121 visual features with morphological characteristics extracted from predicted segmentation masks, creating a hybrid appearance-morphology analysis approach.

"Background: While arthroscopic irrigation and débridement are commonly used to treat septic arthritis of the shoulder because of their minimally invasive nature and favorable clinical outcomes, reinfection remains a concern. Povidone-iodine has demonstrated broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and is increasingly used for surgical site irrigation. However, its efficacy and safety in the arthroscopic management of septic shoulder arthritis have not been well established. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 15 shoulders in 15 patients with septic arthritis of the shoulder who underwent arthroscopic irrigation and débridement using a 0.35% povidone-iodine solution. Functional outcomes, reoperation rates for reinfection, and radiographic changes were assessed after a minimum postoperative follow-up period of 6 months. Results: Although the reoperation rate for reinfection was 0%, 1 patient (6.7%, 1 of 15) experienced reinfection, which was managed nonoperatively. No adverse effects attributable to povidone-iodine were observed. Radiographic progression of glenohumeral arthritis was noted in 4 patients (26.7%).

"Copper(II) ion (Cu2+) are vital trace elements however, their imbalance is linked to serious health disorders such as Wilson's disease, Menkes syndrome, and neurodegenerative conditions, as well as environmental toxicity. Conventional analytical methods, though precise, are costly and unsuitable for rapid or on-site detection. Imidazole-based chemosensors have emerged as promising alternatives because of their excellent Cu2+ binding capability, tunable photophysical properties, and simple design. Their sensing responses are mediated by chelation-enhanced fluorescence/quenching, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and photoinduced electron transfer (PET). Since 2015 imidazole derivatives, such as Schiff base imidazole, bis-imidazole, imidazolium salts, and N-heterocyclic carbine precursors have demonstrated excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and low detection limits, with readout modes spanning colorimetric, fluorescence turn-on/turn-off, and ratiometric sensing.

"Three-dimensional porous scaffolds with the capability of controlled drug release have gained increasing interest in chemotherapy due to their sustained release of drugs and ability to reduce systemic toxicity. In this study, we advanced this concept by incorporating drug-loaded nanocarriers into 3D-printed scaffolds, creating trackable constructs for medical imaging such as CT-scan. Doxorubicin-loaded/folic acid-targeted pH-sensitive nanohydroxyapatite (Dox@nHA-FA) were synthesized and incorporated into gelatin/polycaprolactone/hydroxyapatite (Gel/PCL/HA) scaffolds via 3D printing. The Gel/PCL/HA(Dox@HA-FA) scaffolds were extensively characterized for drug release, mechanical strength, microstructure, and degradation profile.

"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by abnormal amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, which causes neural damage and cognitive decline. Aβ positron emission tomography (PET) serves as the gold standard for preclinical diagnosis of AD. However, practical limitations, including high costs, radiation exposure, and constrained accessibility, have motivated recent studies to indirectly predict Aβ deposition patterns from MRI data. Unfortunately, existing methods have not fully leveraged the coupled pathological information from both functional and structural brain networks. To address this gap, we propose Graph Reconstruction-Aware Fusion (GRAF), a novel framework designed to predict regional Aβ-PET patterns by integrating functional and structural pathological information. GRAF employs a graph-masked autoencoder to learn integrated network topology embeddings by reconstructing masked edges from both functional and structural networks, effectively utilizing node and edge features. Subsequently, the well-trained encoders are fine-tuned to predict regional Aβ patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed GRAF framework outperforms six state-of-the-art",Aβ-PET Pattern Prediction via Graph Reconstruction-Aware Fusion (GRAF) of Functional and Structural Networks,medical imaging,Conference paper,,alzheimer disease ad characterized abnormal amyloid deposition cause neural damage cognitive decline positron emission tomography pet serf gold standard preclinical diagnosis ad however practical limitation including high cost radiation exposure constrained accessibility motivated recent study indirectly predict deposition pattern mri data unfortunately existing method fully leveraged coupled pathological information functional structural brain network address gap propose graph reconstruction aware fusion graf novel framework designed predict regional pet pattern integrating functional structural pathological information graf employ graph masked autoencoder learn integrated network topology embeddings reconstructing masked edge functional structural network effectively utilizing node edge feature subsequently well trained encoders fine tuned predict regional pattern extensive experimental result demonstrate proposed graf framework outperforms six state art
"Facial reconstructive surgery requires precise preoperative planning to optimize functional and aesthetic outcomes, but current imaging technologies like CT and MRI do not offer visualization of expected post-surgical appearance, limiting surgical planning capabilities. We developed a deep learning framework integrating facial inpainting and monocular depth estimation models to predict surgical outcomes and enable 2D and 3D planning from clinical photographs. Three state-of-the-art inpainting architectures (LaMa, LGNet, MAT) and three monocular depth estimation approaches (ZoeDepth, Depth Anything V2, DepthPro) were evaluated using the FFHQ dataset for inpainting and C3I-SynFace dataset for depth estimation, with comprehensive quantitative metrics assessing reconstruction quality and depth accuracy. For anatomically specific facial features, LGNet demonstrated superior performance across eyebrows (PSNR: 25.11, SSIM: 0.75), eyes (PSNR: 20.08, SSIM: 0.53), nose (PSNR: 25.70, SSIM: 0.88), and mouth (PSNR: 22.39, SSIM: 0.75), with statistically significant differences confirmed by paired t-tests (p < 0.001) and large effect sizes (Cohen’s d",Deep Learning Framework for Facial Reconstruction Outcome Prediction: Integrating Image Inpainting and Depth Estimation for Computer-Assisted Surgical Planning,medical imaging,Article,,facial reconstructive surgery requires precise preoperative planning optimize functional aesthetic outcome current imaging technology like ct mri offer visualization expected post surgical appearance limiting surgical planning capability developed deep learning framework integrating facial inpainting monocular depth estimation model predict surgical outcome enable planning clinical photograph three state art inpainting architecture lama lgnet mat three monocular depth estimation approach zoedepth depth anything depthpro evaluated using ffhq dataset inpainting synface dataset depth estimation comprehensive quantitative metric assessing reconstruction quality depth accuracy anatomically specific facial feature lgnet demonstrated superior performance across eyebrow psnr ssim eye psnr ssim nose psnr ssim mouth psnr ssim statistically significant difference confirmed paired test large effect size cohen
"Purpose: Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a practical imaging modality for capturing information about regional thoracic-abdominal components and their dynamics in healthy children and pediatric patients with thoracic insufficiency syndrome (TIS). We propose an auto-segmentation set-up for the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen, and thoraco-abdominal skin outer boundary (Skn) in dMRI images. Methods: The segmentation setup has been implemented in two steps, recognition and delineation, using two deep neural network (DL) architectures, DL-R and DL-D for the recognition and delineation steps, respectively. The encoder-decoder framework in DL-D utilizes features at four different resolution levels to counter the challenges involved in segmentation. dMRI sagittal slice acquisitions of 189 (near-)normal subjects were evaluated, with an in-plane spatial resolution of roughly 1 × 1 mm2 with 6.00 mm spacing between slices.

"Polyp segmentation is a representative task in computer-aided clinical diagnosis in colonoscopy analysis. However, strict regulations limit the availability of large, high-quality image-mask paired datasets for segmentation. As a result, recent studies have focused on models that generate images conditioned on masks. However, due to rigid annotation constraints and a high reliance on fixed masks, the synthesized images often exhibit limited variation, leading to a lack of generalization in downstream tasks. This study introduces the Semantic Interpolative Diffusion Model (SIDM), which applies interpolation to both the given masks and the colonoscopy images to generate pairs of interpolated masks and images. First, a background semantic label was devised by labeling background regions based on the colonoscopy imaging environment. Both the masks and the background semantic labels are applied as multi-conditions to the diffusion model for colonoscopy image generation. After training, interpolation on both the masks and background semantic labels is performed",Semantic Interpolative Diffusion Model: Bridging the Interpolation to Masks and Colonoscopy Image Synthesis for Robust Generalization,medical imaging,Conference paper,,polyp segmentation representative task computer aided clinical diagnosis colonoscopy analysis however strict regulation limit availability large high quality image mask paired datasets segmentation result recent study focused model generate image conditioned mask however due rigid annotation constraint high reliance fixed mask synthesized image often exhibit limited variation leading lack generalization downstream task study introduces semantic interpolative diffusion model sidm applies interpolation given mask colonoscopy image generate pair interpolated mask image first background semantic label devised labeling background region based colonoscopy imaging environment mask background semantic label applied multi condition diffusion model colonoscopy image generation training interpolation mask background semantic label performed

"Choledocholithiasis remains a common disease process to treat in modern medicine, but few are aware of its fascinating history. Starting with the preliminary understandings of ancient civilizations, significant strides in anatomic and pathologic characterization were made during the 16–18th centuries. In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the first cholecystectomy was performed, crossing an important surgical milestone that opened the door to further biliary intervention. Diagnostic advances were made and imaging techniques improved in the twentieth century, notably with Dr. George Berci’s groundbreaking advancement of cholangiography and performance of the first endoscopic common bile duct exploration. The development of endoscopic cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in the 1970s and the introduction of laparoscopy brought the management of biliary disease into the modern era.

"Background and Aim: The etiological profile of acute febrile encephalopathy (AFE) varies across different geographic areas and in different seasons across the world. Limited literature in children suggests central nervous system (CNS) infections to be the most common cause of AFE in India and developing countries. Most of these studies have been done in the plains of India, and no study has been done in the Himalayan region of northwestern India, where most of the vectors causing AFE in other parts of India, like mosquitoes, are not found. Therefore, this leads to a lacuna in available data on the etiological profile in this region with an elevation of 1000–21,000 ft from the sea level. Our aim was to study the clinical and etiological profile of pediatric AFE and the risk factors associated with mortality in AFE in Himachal Pradesh, a hilly Himalayan state of India located in northwestern Himalayas.

"Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early diagnosis of the disease is one of the most important factors in reducing mortality or increasing lifespan. Traditionally, healthcare experts use various sources of information to determine a diagnosis, often including some form of imaging along with clinical and demographic data.

"Lung cancer is still a significant contributor to deaths from cancer worldwide, with millions of deaths annually and extremely low survival rates upon diagnosis at advanced stages. Traditional diagnostic methods, including imaging scans and biopsies, are frequently hampered by prohibitive cost, invasive testing, and subjectivity in interpretation, which postpones the initiation of treatment. By using big data to uncover subtle patterns that traditional methods might overlook, this study investigates how lung cancer early detection can be enhanced by machine learning. We investigated a few machines learning techniques such as neural networks, machine logistic regression, random forests, and support vector machines, to evaluate their capacity to differentiate between individuals with and without cancer.

"Physicians and radiologists utilize medical image processing to diagnose diseases. However, medical images can be compromised by noise introduced through various imaging processes, leading to diminished image quality. This degradation manifests as blurred boundaries, suppressed edges, and loss of structural details. Preserving edges and details is crucial for accurate disease diagnosis. Therefore, medical image denoising is essential in aiding physicians with diagnosis. MRI, CT, X-ray, and ultrasound images are examples of common medical image types. To overcome the above problems, this work implemented an Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) with the Self-Improved Orca Predation Algorithm (SI-OPA) for image denoising for medical image denoising. ICNN has been used to treat noise-distorted medical images. The CNN's weights are modified by SI-OPA, increasing the precision of denoising.

Binocular stereo vision has become a mainstream three-dimensional imaging solution in medical imaging analysis and industrial inspection because of its low cost，passive sensing and real-time processing capability. However，conventional stereo matching algorithms exhibit intrinsic limitations when confronting highly reflective and weakly textured objects such as polished ceramics，metals or water-like surfaces. Specular highlights saturate the sensor and obscure surface micro-structure，while the lack of natural texture causes a reduction in reliable feature points，resulting in mismatches，depth discontinuities and holes in reconstructed point clouds. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into active feature augmentation， which relies on projected patterns， added particles or structured light， and passive algorithmic optimization，which refines feature detection or incorporates learning-based priors. Active schemes increase system complexity，cost and sensitivity to environmental illumination，whereas passive schemes remain vulnerable to strong glare and texture scarcity，and often depend on prior knowledge of material properties.

"Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a progressive degenerative joint disease marked by the deterioration of articular cartilage and joint inflammation, which severely affects mobility and diminishes quality of life. Timely and precise detection of KOA is essential to enable early intervention and minimize disease progression.

"Due to the significant increase in breast cancer cases and the limitations of existing early-stage detection techniques, microwave imaging has emerged as a critical tool for the diagnosis of carcinogenic and malignant cells in various tissues. In this work, a 1 × 8 miniaturized metamaterial-based antenna array is conceived and developed for ultrawideband microwave imaging for early breast cancer diagnosis because of its improved accuracy. The developed antenna array features a small dimension, a wide frequency band, a high gain, and broadside radiation properties.

"The brain tumours originate in the brain or its surrounding structures, such as the pituitary and pineal glands, and can be benign or malignant. While benign tumours may grow into neighbouring tissues, metastatic tumours occur when cancer from other organs spreads to the brain. This is because identification and staging of such tumours are critical because basically all aspects involving a patient’s disease entail accurate diagnosis as well as the staging of the tumour. Image segmentation is incredibly valuable to medical imaging since it can make possible to simulate surgical operations, diseases diagnosis, anatomical and pathologic analysis. This study performs the prediction and classification of brain tumours present in MRI, a combined classification and localization framework model is proposed connecting Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) and You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5).

"Purpose: Accurate and robust segmentation of anatomical structures in brain MRI provides a crucial basis for the subsequent observation, analysis, and treatment planning of various brain diseases. Deep learning foundation models trained and designed on large-scale natural scene image datasets experience significant performance degradation when applied to subcortical brain structure segmentation in MRI, limiting their direct applicability in clinical diagnosis.

"Understanding the mechanical behavior of brain tissue is crucial for advancing both fundamental neuroscience and clinical applications. Yet, accurately measuring these properties remains challenging due to the brain's unique mechanical attributes and complex anatomical structures. This review provides a comprehensive overview of commonly used techniques for characterizing brain tissue mechanical properties, covering both invasive methods—such as atomic force microscopy, indentation, axial mechanical testing, and oscillatory shear testing—and noninvasive approaches like magnetic resonance elastography and ultrasound elastography. Each technique is evaluated in terms of working principles, applicability, representative studies, and experimental limitations. We further summarize existing publications that have used these techniques to measure human brain tissue mechanical properties. With a primary focus on invasive studies, we systematically compare their sample preparation, testing conditions, reported mechanical parameters, and modeling strategies. Key sensitivity factors influencing testing outcomes (e.g., sample size, anatomical location, strain rate, temperature, conditioning, and post-mortem interval) are also discussed.","Mechanical characterization of brain tissue: experimental techniques, human testing considerations, and perspectives",medical imaging,Review,,understanding mechanical behavior brain tissue crucial advancing fundamental neuroscience clinical application yet accurately measuring property remains challenging due brain unique mechanical attribute complex anatomical structure review provides comprehensive overview commonly used technique characterizing brain tissue mechanical property covering invasive method atomic force microscopy indentation axial mechanical testing oscillatory shear testing noninvasive approach like magnetic resonance elastography ultrasound elastography technique evaluated term working principle applicability representative study experimental limitation summarize existing publication used technique measure human brain tissue mechanical property primary focus invasive study systematically compare sample preparation testing condition reported mechanical parameter modeling strategy key sensitivity factor influencing testing outcome sample size anatomical location strain rate temperature conditioning post mortem interval also discussed

"The development of small-molecule near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorophores for high-contrast bioimaging is desirable, but challenging. Here, we report the design of a new class of NIR-II dyes, named AFlavs, created via framework integration of flavylium and polymethine scaffolds. These asymmetric molecules exhibit high brightness (227–2396 M–1 cm–1), superior photostability, and strong resistance to quenching, making them ideal for advanced bioimaging. Among them, AFlav-4 stands out for its performance in vascular imaging, including tumor vasculature disruption, ischemia-reperfusion evaluation, and bone-targeted delivery via nanoparticles. Notably, AFlavs enabled two-, three-, and four-color multiplex imaging via more than 100 nm absorption separation, achieving spectral orthogonality uncommon among the currently reported small-molecule NIR-II fluorophores.

"Multi-modal brain imaging with MRI, CT, and PET has significantly advanced our understanding of cognition and neurodisease by providing complementary information. However, constraints on scan time and cost often result in missing critical high-quality sequences. Existing cross-modality synthesis methods are typically task- or modality-specific, leading to performance degradation when applied to heterogeneous real-world imaging data. Here, we propose UniSyn, a unified framework capable of synthesizing target imaging modalities with specific acquisition parameters from any available ones, guided by metadata. UniSyn first learns robust metadata representations through image-text alignment on large-scale multimodal neuroimaging datasets. We then introduce a cross-modality synthesis framework that leverages learned metadata representations to guide the generation of metadata-specified target images. To enhance interpretable metadata-driven control over image synthesis across diverse protocols, we design a dual-parameter arithmetic operation that explicitly integrates source and target metadata into the image translation process.

"Achieving equity in healthcare accessibility requires lightweight yet high-performance solutions for medical image segmentation, particularly in resource-limited settings. Existing methods like U-Net and its variants often suffer from limited global Effective Receptive Fields (ERFs), hindering their ability to capture long-range dependencies. To address this, we propose U-RWKV, a novel framework leveraging the Recurrent Weighted Key-Value(RWKV) architecture, which achieves efficient long-range modeling at O(N) computational cost. The framework introduces two key innovations: the Direction-Adaptive RWKV Module(DARM) and the Stage-Adaptive Squeeze-and-Excitation Module(SASE). DARM employs Dual-RWKV and QuadScan mechanisms to aggregate contextual cues across images, mitigating directional bias while preserving global context and maintaining high computational efficiency. SASE dynamically adapts its architecture to different feature extraction stages, balancing high-resolution detail preservation and semantic relationship capture. Experiments demonstrate that U-RWKV achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with high computational efficiency, offering a practical solution for democratizing advanced medical imaging technologies in resource-constrained environments.

"Purpose of Review: Urinary stone disease is among the most common non-obstetric conditions in pregnancy and carries significant maternal-fetal morbidity. Diagnosis and management are challenging, as the accuracy and efficacy of different modalities must be balanced against their pregnancy-specific risks. This narrative review evaluates society guidelines and emerging evidence on stone disease in pregnancy, focusing on population-based and comparative studies published since 2010. Recent Findings: Adverse maternal-fetal outcomes associated with urinary stone disease in pregnancy may be exacerbated by delays and inconsistencies in care. Ultrasound is the recommended first-line imaging modality, but diagnostic accuracy is limited; emerging evidence supports low-dose CT as an alternative when diagnostic certainty is required. Conservative management remains the standard initial approach in uncomplicated cases. Evidence regarding tamsulosin in medical expulsive therapy is inconclusive. When surgical management is necessary, prompt decompression should be considered; ureteral stenting may be favored over percutaneous nephrostomy in certain cases.

"Background: Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is a critical condition resulting from increased intra-compartmental pressure, causing tissue ischemia and necrosis. ACS following cardiovascular surgery is rare but catastrophic. Postoperative sedation and analgesia often obscure classic symptoms, delaying diagnosis. This underscores the importance of vigilance and early detection, particularly in high-risk scenarios such as prolonged extracorporeal circulation and femoral artery cannulation. Enhanced monitoring, including tissue oxygen saturation and transcutaneous oxygen pressure, may facilitate timely diagnosis.

"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women worldwide, and early detection and diagnosis are crucial for improving treatment outcomes. Three types of deep learning (DL) models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transformer models, and hybrid models that combine CNNs and transformers, have been widely applied to the classification of ultrasound images. However, these models still face the bottleneck of extracting critical features, and limited generalization in practical applications. Therefore, we propose an image segmentation and feature weighting method for the three-class classification of breast cancer nodules. Our approach uses two modules: the segmentation module and weight regularization, which enhance global feature extraction by adjusting the weights of the segmented image features.

"With the rapid development of digital technology, graphics are playing an increasingly important role in many fields, such as medical imaging, satellite remote sensing, and security monitoring. However, due to factors such as equipment and transmission, graphics often have poor clarity such as blur and distortion, which limits their effective application in practical scenarios. This paper systematically deblurs and enhances graphics by constructing a targeted convolutional neural network model to improve clarity. First, the classic convolutional neural network architecture is optimized to design a network structure suitable for optimizing image clarity. Second, transfer learning and data enhancement techniques are used to improve the model training effect. The experimental results show that the PSNR is improved by 2.64 dB, the SSIM is improved by 0.047, and the VIF is increased by 0.084 compared with SRCNN, proving that the model is effective in improving image clarity and structural similarity.

"Dermoscopy, a non-invasive imaging technique, has transformed dermatology by enabling early detection and differentiation of skin conditions. Integrating deep learning with dermoscopic images enhances diagnostic potential but raises computational challenges. This study introduces APNet, an attention-based architecture designed for melanoma detection, offering fewer parameters than conventional convolutional neural networks. Two baseline models are considered: HU-Net, a trimmed U-Net that uses only the encoding path for classification, and Pocket-Net, a lightweight U-Net variant that reduces parameters through fewer feature maps and efficient convolutions. While Pocket-Net is highly resource-efficient, its simplification can reduce performance. APNet extends Pocket-Net by incorporating squeeze-and-excitation (SE) attention blocks into the encoding path. These blocks adaptively highlight the most relevant dermoscopic features, such as subtle melanoma patterns, improving classification accuracy. The study evaluates APNet against Pocket-Net and HU-Net using four large, annotated dermoscopy datasets (ISIC 2017–2020), covering melanoma, benign nevi, and other lesions.

"This paper presents a novel framework for real-time medical image registration that synergistically combines Mamba optimization, dynamic deformation fields, and transformer-based architectures. The proposed framework addresses key challenges in the field by achieving a balance between high spatial registration accuracy and computational efficiency, while also adapting to temporal anatomical variations commonly encountered in dynamic imaging scenarios. Specifically, Mamba optimization is employed to prune redundant transformer layers and introduce adaptive learning strategies, resulting in reduced inference time and memory usage without sacrificing accuracy. Mamba, a state-space model-based transformer alternative, is used to prune redundant layers and achieve real-time efficiency. Dynamic deformation fields are introduced to provide temporal flexibility, allowing the model to adapt in real time to physiological motions such as respiration and cardiac cycles. Furthermore, the integration of multi-scale CNN encoders and transformer-based global attention enables precise spatial alignment across varying anatomical structures.

"Accurate detection and segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy are of great significance for the early prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer. However, due to the considerable variations in polyp size and shape, as well as their blurred boundaries with surrounding tissues, polyps are often difficult to detect, making precise segmentation a challenging task.

"Artificial intelligence has made great advances in the healthcare field, particularly in medical imaging. However, data and annotations in this area are often scarce and expensive. Although essential for machine learning models, labeling images is a tedious and time-consuming task. Active learning addresses this challenge by selecting informative samples, and using less annotated data while still getting a good model performance. The proposed solution uses the PatchCamelyon dataset, with patches from histopathologic scans of sentinel lymph node sections for the detection of metastatic tissue in breast cancer patients. This work proposes an active learning approach that uses both the informativeness of the sample and the distribution of data. The solution showed promising results when compared to a random sampling approach. In some iterations, the difference between the F1 score in the proposed active learning solution and random sampling was greater than 0,20. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer",Application of Active Learning on Medical Images to Enhance Machine Learning Models,medical imaging,Conference paper,,artificial intelligence made great advance healthcare field particularly medical imaging however data annotation area often scarce expensive although essential machine learning model labeling image tedious time consuming task active learning address challenge selecting informative sample using less annotated data still getting good model performance proposed solution us patchcamelyon dataset patch histopathologic scan sentinel lymph node section detection metastatic tissue breast cancer patient work proposes active learning approach us informativeness sample distribution data solution showed promising result compared random sampling approach iteration difference score proposed active learning solution random sampling greater author exclusive license springer

"Background: Cancers are characterized by high heterogeneity. This study seeks to identify the factors driving hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) heterogeneity to aid in prognostic stratification and inform personalized treatment approaches. Methods: We used a computational pipeline to integrate multiomics data from HCC patients, applying 10 clustering algorithms. These results were combined with a machine learning framework to identify high-resolution molecular subtypes (MSs) and to create a robust molecular subtype–related risk score (MSRRS). Subsequent integrated bioinformatics algorithms further analyzed the heterogeneity of HCC at the level of molecular pathways, therapeutic response, and tumor microenvironment, thereby assessing potential clinical value. Results: Through multiomics clustering, we identified two heterogeneous MSs associated with prognosis, with MS2 exhibiting a more favorable prognostic outcome. Subsequently, we applied bootstrap resampling-based univariate Cox regression and Boruta algorithm to screen for more clinically relevant genes from the marker genes of each MS.

"The high incidence and mortality rate of cardiac arrest (CA) establishes it as a critical clinical challenge in emergency medicine globally. Despite continuous advances in advanced life support (ALS) technology, the prognosis for patients experiencing cardiac arrest remains poor, with cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury (CIRI) being a significant determinant of adverse neurological outcomes and increased mortality. Sirtuins (SIRTs) are a class of highly evolutionarily conserved NAD+-dependent histone deacylenzymes capable of regulating the expression of various cytoprotective genes to play a neuroprotective role in CIRI. SIRTs mainly regulate the levels of downstream proteins such as PGC 1-α, Nrf 2, NLRP 3, FoxOs, and PINK 1 to inhibit inflammatory response, attenuate oxidative stress, improve mitochondrial dysfunction, promote angiogenesis, and inhibit apoptosis while reducing CIRI. Natural active ingredients are widely used in regulating the protein level of SIRTs in the body because of their multi-components, multi-pathway, multi-target, and minimal toxic side effects.",Role of sirtuins in cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury: Mechanisms and therapeutic potential,precision medicine,Review,,high incidence mortality rate cardiac arrest ca establishes critical clinical challenge emergency medicine globally despite continuous advance advanced life support al technology prognosis patient experiencing cardiac arrest remains poor cerebral ischemia reperfusion injury ciri significant determinant adverse neurological outcome increased mortality sirtuins sirts class highly evolutionarily conserved nad dependent histone deacylenzymes capable regulating expression various cytoprotective gene play neuroprotective role ciri sirts mainly regulate level downstream protein pgc nrf nlrp foxos pink inhibit inflammatory response attenuate oxidative stress improve mitochondrial dysfunction promote angiogenesis inhibit apoptosis reducing ciri natural active ingredient widely used regulating protein level sirts body multi component multi pathway multi target minimal toxic side effect
"Breast cancer remains the most prevalent cancer among women, where accurate and interpretable analysis of pathology images is vital for early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. However, conventional single-network models fall short in balancing both performance and explainability—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) lack the capacity to capture global contextual information, while Transformers are limited in modeling fine-grained local details. To overcome these challenges and contribute to the advancement of Explainable AI (XAI) in precision cancer diagnosis, this paper proposes MVT-OFML (Multi-View Transformer Online Fusion Mutual Learning), a novel and interpretable classification framework for breast cancer pathology images.

"The COVID-19 crisis emphasizes the essential role of accurate viral genome identification in guiding effective public health measures and therapeutic decisions. This paper presents a comparative analysis of deep learning (DL) models, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and BERT-based transformers-for classifying genomic sequences of HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Leveraging the sequential nature of DNA data, LSTM effectively captures long-range dependencies, while BERT utilizes contextual embeddings. Experimental results show that LSTM achieves 90.00% accuracy, significantly outperforming the BERT-based model at 50.5%. Evaluated on a diverse dataset, LSTM demonstrates superior recall, F1 score, and precision, indicating its robustness in detecting genetic variations. These findings suggest that while transformer-based models like BERT excel in NLP, sequence-based architectures such as LSTM are better suited for genomic classification. The results contribute to advancing artificial intelligence applications genomics, with significant implications for viral diagnostics, outbreak monitoring, and precision medicine. © 2025 IEEE.

This study developed a biomimetic empagliflozin nanosystem (Empa@IRT) capable of traversing the blood-brain barrier (BBB), achieving active targeting and prolonged circulation in vivo. Specifically, empagliflozin was encapsulated within fused cell membranes and subsequently conjugated with transferrin (Tf), which addressed the issues of poor water solubility and challenging targeted delivery to orthotopic glioblastoma (GBM) cells. Furthermore, we incorporated indocyanine green (ICG) as an imaging probe for in vivo fluorescence visualization, aiding in the precise localization of tumor tissues and facilitating the integration of diagnosis and therapy. Our findings indicate that Empa@IRT can effectively penetrate the BBB and access tumor regions through larger pores within tumor-fenestrated vascular networks to capture sufficient thermal energy activated by near-infrared radiation (NIR), thereby enabling",Bionic empagliflozin nanosystem with enhanced blood-brain barrier penetration for targeted glioblastoma theranostics: A novel strategy to repurpose conventional drugs,precision medicine,Article,,empagliflozin sodium glucose cotransporter sglt inhibitor widely utilized clinical treatment type diabetes demonstrates notable antitumor activity may facilitate development novel anticancer therapeutic study developed biomimetic empagliflozin nanosystem capable traversing blood brain barrier bbb achieving active targeting prolonged circulation vivo specifically empagliflozin encapsulated within fused cell membrane subsequently conjugated transferrin tf addressed issue poor water solubility challenging targeted delivery orthotopic glioblastoma gbm cell furthermore incorporated indocyanine green icg imaging probe vivo fluorescence visualization aiding precise localization tumor tissue facilitating integration diagnosis therapy finding indicate effectively penetrate bbb access tumor region larger pore within tumor fenestrated vascular network capture sufficient thermal energy activated near infrared radiation nir thereby enabling
"Despite the central role of antibodies in modern medicine, no method currently exists to design novel, epitope-specific antibodies entirely in silico. Instead, antibody discovery currently relies on immunization, random library screening or the isolation of antibodies directly from patients1. Here we demonstrate that combining computational protein design using a fine-tuned RFdiffusion2 network with yeast display screening enables the de novo generation of antibody variable heavy chains (VHHs), single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and full antibodies that bind to user-specified epitopes with atomic-level precision. We experimentally characterize VHH binders to four disease-relevant epitopes. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms the binding pose of designed VHHs targeting influenza haemagglutinin and Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). A high-resolution structure of the influenza-targeting VHH confirms atomic accuracy of the designed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs).

"Lysosomal diseases (LDs) are a group of rare inherited disorders belonging to inborn metabolism errors. LDs are characterized by the excessive storage of undegraded substrates, most often due to the enzymatic deficiency resulting from disease-causing gene variants. LDs lead to dysregulated cellular pathways and imbalanced molecular homeostasis and can affect multiple organs and tissues. Despite being rare, LDs account for a significant incidence when considered collectively. Due to complex molecular and genetic fingerprints, considerable challenges in LD management must be overcome. Diagnosis can be significantly delayed due to the broad and nonspecific clinical manifestations and the lack of specific biomarkers. Available treatments fail to fully stop the disease progression and can alter the disease's typical phenotypes with novel manifestations. Therefore, a paradigm shift is crucial to better understand LDs and provide actionable insights. Herein, we comprehensively review the literature to demonstrate that multi-omics approaches are promising for pathophysiology elucidation, biomarker",A multi-omics-empowered framework for precision diagnosis and treatment of lysosomal diseases,precision medicine,Review,,lysosomal disease lds group rare inherited disorder belonging inborn metabolism error lds characterized excessive storage undegraded substrate often due enzymatic deficiency resulting disease causing gene variant lds lead dysregulated cellular pathway imbalanced molecular homeostasis affect multiple organ tissue despite rare lds account significant incidence considered collectively due complex molecular genetic fingerprint considerable challenge ld management must overcome diagnosis significantly delayed due broad nonspecific clinical manifestation lack specific biomarkers available treatment fail fully stop disease progression alter disease typical phenotype novel manifestation therefore paradigm shift crucial better understand lds provide actionable insight herein comprehensively review literature demonstrate multi omics approach promising pathophysiology elucidation biomarker
"Spatiotemporally controlled cancer therapy may offer great advantages in precision medicine, but still remains some challenges in programmed sequential release and co-localization of components at target sites.

The first irradiation can activate the photosensitizer bound in cancer cells internalized TCC@M to release Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) by photodynamic effect. The released Cas9 RNP then enters the nuclei directed by the fused nuclear localization sequence in Cas9 to cleave the heat shock protein (HSP) 90α gene, which greatly reduces the expression of HSP90α protein and thus effectively sensitizes cancer cells to heat, leading to enhanced PTT at a mild temperature (<45 °C) risen by Ti₃C₂ MXenes under the second irradiation.

"Background: Topiramate reduces alcohol consumption in individuals who drink heavily. Candidate gene studies aimed at identifying genetic variants that predict topiramate's effects on drinking have yielded inconsistent findings. To identify genetic variation associated with treatment response, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) among participants in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) who initiated topiramate treatment. Methods: Using electronic health records, we identified individuals who were dispensed topiramate for at least 60 days for any indication (i.e., the index event). Alcohol consumption was assessed using Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) scores during the year prior to topiramate exposure (pre index) and at least 60 days after initiating topiramate but within 6 months of drug discontinuation (post index). The final GWAS sample included 8386 individuals who reported alcohol consumption (i.e., AUDIT-C score > 0) during the preceding year.

"Ganoderma lucidum (Lingzhi), a traditional medicinal mushroom, is renowned for its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties, primarily attributed to its bioactive components such as polysaccharides and triterpenoids. This review focuses on the mechanisms by which Ganoderma lucidum modulates immune responses, particularly in the context of gut–liver–brain axis disorders. Polysaccharides enhance immune function by activating macrophages, natural killer cells, and T cells, thereby promoting phagocytosis and cytokine production. Triterpenoids contribute through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, inhibiting inflammatory mediators and protecting tissues from damage. Ganoderma lucidum also influences immune regulation via key signaling pathways, including NF-κB and MAPK, and supports immune tolerance, potentially reducing the risk of autoimmune diseases. Additionally, it modulates gut microbiota, which further impacts systemic immunity. Importantly, polysaccharides and triterpenoids demonstrate promising clinical application prospects in metabolic diseases, inflammatory conditions, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer immunotherapy, attributed to their multi-target immunomodulatory activities and prebiotic properties.

"Despite advances in lipid-lowering and antithrombotic therapy, patients with acute coronary syndromes remain at elevated risk for recurrent events due to persistent atherosclerotic inflammation. This review evaluates inflammation as a therapeutic target in secondary prevention and discusses established, investigational, and emerging strategies. Colchicine, now FDA-approved for cardiovascular risk reduction, lowered major adverse cardiovascular events in COLCOT and LoDoCo2. Canakinumab (IL-1β inhibition) reduced recurrent events in proportion to IL-6 and hsCRP suppression, while ziltivekimab (IL-6 inhibition) achieved profound biomarker reductions but remains investigational.

"Recently, model-assisted designs, including a Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design with optimal thresholds for determining the dose for the next cohort, have been proposed for Phase I cancer studies. Model-assisted designs are useful owing to their good performance in addition to their algorithm-based simplicity. In this era of precision medicine, drug combinations are widely used to enhance treatment efficacy and overcome resistance to monotherapies. However, identification of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) combinations is complicated because the joint toxicity order of paired doses is only partially known. BOIN and Keyboard combination designs are the only model-assisted designs developed to date. Further, both these combination designs show similar operational characteristics. Despite the simplicity and superior performance of model-assisted designs, they have not been sufficiently studied in Phase I drug combination trials.

"Introduction: Hypertension has a multifactorial etiology. Recent studies have revealed a link between hypertension and gut microbiota dysbiosis. Pulse wave analysis holds significant clinical value for hypertension risk assessment. While research on deep learning models utilizing photoplethysmography (PPG) for hypertension classification has advanced, limitations persist. PPG offers limited richness and accuracy for characterizing blood pressure-related pathological information. In contrast, Arterial Pressure Waveform (APW) provides richer pathological information and exhibit stronger correlations with clinically interpretable features. However, deep learning research using APW for hypertension classification remains limited, as existing studies focus primarily on local feature extraction and neglect global temporal dynamics. Methods: To address these challenges, we propose a novel 1D-CNN-BiLSTM-Transformer architecture for hypertension risk assessment based on APW, where the 1D-CNN module extracts waveform morphology features from signals within individual pressure segments, the BiLSTM module models long-range temporal dependencies from signals within each segment, and the Transformer module explicitly captures",1DCNN-BiLSTM-transformer hypertension risk prediction model based on APW,precision medicine,Article,,introduction hypertension multifactorial etiology recent study revealed link hypertension gut microbiota dysbiosis pulse wave analysis hold significant clinical value hypertension risk assessment research deep learning model utilizing photoplethysmography ppg hypertension classification advanced limitation persist ppg offer limited richness accuracy characterizing blood pressure related pathological information contrast arterial pressure waveform apw provides richer pathological information exhibit stronger correlation clinically interpretable feature however deep learning research using apw hypertension classification remains limited existing study focus primarily local feature extraction neglect global temporal dynamic method address challenge propose novel cnn bilstm transformer architecture hypertension risk assessment based apw cnn module extract waveform morphology feature signal within individual pressure segment bilstm module model long range temporal dependency signal within segment transformer module explicitly capture

"Enhancing athletic performance through the manipulation of nutritional intake has ancient roots, with early guidance from “philosophical giants” like Hippocrates, who describes the balance between diet and exercise. Modern sports nutrition emerged in the 20th century, with research identifying carbohydrate (CHO) intake as beneficial for endurance. Studies like Gordon's in the 1920s linked blood glucose levels to marathon performance, while Cade's research in the 1960s on fluid and electrolyte intake led to the founding of Gatorade and the shift toward drinking during exercise to allegedly prevent dehydration and improve sporting performance. Today, sports nutrition is in a “holding pattern” after significant developments in the 1980s, 1990s, and the 2000s.

The PPT platform integrates intrinsic antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties to neutralize OA-associated oxidative stress and inflammation while enhancing bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) survival via Hedgehog signaling activation, overcoming limitations of conventional cell delivery. By incorporating a pro-differentiation agent, PPT hydrogel steers BMSCs toward stable hyaline cartilage regeneration, suppressing the formation of fibrotic and hypertrophic cartilage even under inflammatory conditions. Furthermore, PPT amplifies BMSCs paracrine signaling to restore redox homeostasis and autophagy flux in resident chondrocytes through FOXO1-dependent mechanisms, establishing a self-reinforcing therapeutic loop.",Modular hydrogel niche orchestrates microenvironment detoxification and stem cell redirecting toward precision osteoarthritis therapy,precision medicine,Article,,osteoarthritis oa debilitating degenerative joint disease driven chronic inflammation cartilage degradation remains inadequately addressed current therapy mesenchymal stem cell msc offer regenerative potential clinical efficacy hindered poor survival transient retention pathological joint microenvironments present bioengineered hydrogel based stem cell niche ppt hydrogel dynamically coordinate microenvironmental reprogramming msc functional redirection achieve sustained oa treatment ppt platform integrates intrinsic antioxidative anti inflammatory property neutralize oa associated oxidative stress inflammation enhancing bone marrow msc bmscs survival via hedgehog signaling activation overcoming limitation conventional cell delivery incorporating pro differentiation agent ppt hydrogel steer bmscs toward stable hyaline cartilage regeneration suppressing formation fibrotic hypertrophic cartilage even inflammatory condition furthermore ppt amplifies bmscs paracrine signaling restore redox homeostasis autophagy flux resident chondrocytes foxo dependent mechanism establishing self reinforcing therapeutic loop
"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are aggressive malignancies with limited therapeutic options and poor prognoses. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have gained attention as key molecular regulators involved in tumor progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis. This review explores the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic potential of miRNAs in CCA and PDAC, emphasizing their shared and distinct molecular pathways and their utility in the context of precision oncology. Several dysregulated miRNAs, most notably miR-21 and miR-155, are overexpressed in both cancers and contribute to activation of oncogenic pathways such as PI3K/AKT signaling, epithelial–mesenchymal transition, and inflammatory cascades. miR-21, in particular, is associated with resistance to gemcitabine and cisplatin. In contrast, tumor-suppressive miRNAs such as miR-34a and miR-145 are often downregulated, and their restoration using synthetic mimics has demonstrated promising antitumor effects in preclinical studies. Moreover, circulating miRNAs show potential as non-invasive biomarkers for early detection and disease monitoring.

"Background: Early identification of children at risk of asthma attacks is important for optimizing treatment strategies. We aimed to integrate salivary microbiome and serum inflammatory mediator profiles with asthma attacks history to develop a comprehensive predictive model for future attacks. Methods: This study contained a discovery (SysPharmPediA) and a replication phase (U-BIOPRED). School-aged children with asthma were classified into at risk and no-risk groups, based on the presence or absence of one or more severe attacks during one-year follow-up. Prediction models were developed using random forest on the training set (70%) with data on past asthma attacks, microbiome composition, serum inflammatory mediator levels, and their combinations and then tested on the rest of the population (30%). Outcomes were replicated in a subset of children with severe asthma from U-BIOPRED. Results: Complete data were available for 154 children (SysPharmPediA = 121, U-BIOPRED = 33).

"Artificial intelligence has empowered precision medicine (AI-PM) to transform healthcare. This study synthesized available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of AI-PM. We systematically searched five major databases for economic evaluations of AI-PM, extracted data, and assessed risk-of-bias using the Bias in Economic Evaluation (ECOBIAS) checklist. For cost-utility analyses, the value-for-money was quantitatively summarized, and regression analyses incorporating machine learning were conducted to explore value heterogeneity. Forty-eight economic evaluations were included, of which 31 were cost-utility analyses. Although risk-of-bias assessment indicated potential systematic optimism, AI-PM was cost-saving or cost-effective in 89% of base-case analyses, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from dominant to $129,174/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Interquartile ranges of incremental costs (−$259 to $28), QALY gains (0.001–0.019), and net monetary benefits (NMB; $18 to $986 at a willingness-to-pay threshold equal to one-time per-capita GDP) indicated modest health gains at minimal additional costs, and likely high value heterogeneity.

"Elucidating the biochemical pathways affected by pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is essential for identifying informative blood-based biomarkers that may support future precision medicine and clinical trials. The kynurenine pathway (KP)–the primary route for tryptophan (Trp) degradation–represents a promising candidate due to its established link to (neuro)inflammation and TBI. The current study used liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry to investigate KP metabolites in serum from 54 human patients with pediatric mild TBI (pmTBI; age 8–18 years) at ∼ 7 days and ∼ 4 months post-injury and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). The early temporal trajectories of KP metabolites were examined in more detail in serum samples collected from 33 juvenile swine with mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (mmTBI) at pre-injury baseline, and at 5 min, 35 min, 2.5 h, 24 h, and 7 days post-injury.

"Atopic dermatitis is a common chronic disease that affects the quality of life of patients and their families and is marked by cyclical periods of flare-ups and remissions. Although there is no cure for the disease, its symptoms can be alleviated with proper management. However, atopic dermatitis is a complex disease that manifests differently in men and women, and the molecular mechanisms behind flare-ups are not yet fully understood. Identifying the genes that characterise lesional and non-lesional skin could improve the current understanding of the key molecular mechanisms and facilitate the development of new targeted therapies. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach aimed at discovering candidate sex-specific biomarkers for the disease. First, we selected the differentially expressed genes and applied feature selection techniques and machine learning methods to reduce the number of features.

"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in depression treatment. However, the relationship between treatment efficacy and plasma concentrations remains unclear. We assessed whether the anti-depressive response can be predicted based on the pharmacokinetic (PK) data of paroxetine, a frequently used SSRI. During treatment, we measured the plasma paroxetine concentrations in 179 paroxetine-treated patients with major depressive disorder. Of these patients, 50 patients had received a pre-treatment personality assessment using the Temperament and Character Inventory at baseline, and their depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline and 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks after treatment initiation. We conducted population PK modeling followed by a population PK-pharmacodynamic (popPK/PD) model to analyze the enhancement in depression severity until 6 weeks of paroxetine treatment using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling.

"Recent advancements in genomics and “omic” technologies have ushered in a transformative era referred to as personalized or precision medicine. This innovative approach considers the unique genetic profiles of individuals, along with a range of variability factors, to devise tailored disease treatments and prevention strategies that cater to the distinct needs of each patient. Although the terms personalized medicine and precision medicine are frequently utilized interchangeably, it is essential to delineate the subtle distinctions between them. Personalized medicine concentrates on bespoke treatments and prevention strategies that are meticulously tailored for each individual. Conversely, precision medicine utilizes advanced gene sequencing and comprehensive data analytics to formulate specific treatments and prevention strategies for defined groups of individuals based on genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors rather than focusing exclusively on individual patients.

"The tumor microenvironment (TME) significantly influences cancer prognosis and therapeutic outcomes, yet its composition remains highly heterogeneous, and currently, no highly accessible, high-throughput method exists to define it. To address this complexity, the TMEclassifier, a machine-learning tool that classifies cancers into three distinct subtypes: immune Exclusive (IE), immune Suppressive (IS), and immune Activated (IA), is developed. Bulk RNA sequencing categorizes patient samples by TME subtype, and in vivo mouse model validates TME subtype differences and differential responses to immunotherapy. The IE subtype is marked by high stromal cell abundance, associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes. The IS subtype features myeloid-derived suppressor cell infiltration, intensifying immunosuppression. In contrast, the IA subtype, often linked to EBV/MSI, exhibits robust T-cell presence and improved immunotherapy response. Single-cell RNA sequencing is applied to explore TME cellular heterogeneity, and in vivo experiments demonstrate that targeting IL-1 counteracts immunosuppression of IS subtype and markedly improves its responsiveness to",Immunotyping the Tumor Microenvironment Reveals Molecular Heterogeneity for Personalized Immunotherapy in Cancer,precision medicine,Article,,tumor microenvironment tme significantly influence cancer prognosis therapeutic outcome yet composition remains highly heterogeneous currently highly accessible high throughput method exists define address complexity tmeclassifier machine learning tool classifies cancer three distinct subtypes immune exclusive ie immune suppressive immune activated ia developed bulk rna sequencing categorizes patient sample tme subtype vivo mouse model validates tme subtype difference differential response immunotherapy ie subtype marked high stromal cell abundance associated aggressive cancer phenotype subtype feature myeloid derived suppressor cell infiltration intensifying immunosuppression contrast ia subtype often linked ebv msi exhibit robust cell presence improved immunotherapy response single cell rna sequencing applied explore tme cellular heterogeneity vivo experiment demonstrate targeting il counteracts immunosuppression subtype markedly improves responsiveness

"Precision Medicine is thought of as having two main pillars: Precision Diagnosis and Precision Therapy. However, for Precision Medicine to reach its full potential, a third pillar is needed that we propose to call Precision Delivery. In the laboratory, many therapies show great efficacy when tested directly with target cells. However, upon clinical translation, they are often given via intravenous or oral administration, resulting in their systemic distribution. To ensure therapies reach target sites at the correct therapeutic levels, they are often given at higher concentrations. However, this can be associated with off-target effects, side-effects, and unwanted interactions. Delivery strategies can help mitigate this by “spatially re-coupling” therapies in vivo with target cells. This review explains the concept of Precision Delivery, which can be thought of as three interconnected, but independent, modules: targeted delivery, microenvironment modulation, and cellular interactions. While locoregional approaches directly deliver therapies into target tissues through endovascular,",The Third Pillar of Precision Medicine — Precision Delivery,precision medicine,Article,,precision medicine thought two main pillar precision diagnosis precision therapy however precision medicine reach full potential third pillar needed propose call precision delivery laboratory many therapy show great efficacy tested directly target cell however upon clinical translation often given via intravenous oral administration resulting systemic distribution ensure therapy reach target site correct therapeutic level often given higher concentration however associated target effect side effect unwanted interaction delivery strategy help mitigate spatially coupling therapy vivo target cell review explains concept precision delivery thought three interconnected independent module targeted delivery microenvironment modulation cellular interaction locoregional approach directly deliver therapy target tissue endovascular
"Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is increasingly linked to systemic metabolic dysfunction, potentially influenced by gut–brain axis dysregulation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Methods: We developed Personalized Metabolic Margin Mapping (PM3), a computational systems biology framework, to analyze RNA-seq data from 12 ASD and 12 control postmortem brain samples. The model focused on 158 curated metabolic genes selected for their roles in redox balance, mitochondrial function, neurodevelopment, and gut–brain interactions. Results: Using unsupervised machine learning (Isolation Forest) to detect outlier expression patterns, Euclidean distance, and percent expression difference metrics, PM3 revealed a consistent downregulation of glycolysis (e.g., −5.4% in PFKM) and mitochondrial enzymes (e.g., −12% in SUCLA2). By incorporating cofactor dependency and subcellular localization, PM3 identified a coordinated suppression of multivitamin transporters (e.g., −4.5% in SLC5A6, −3.5% in SLC19A2), potentially limiting cofactor availability and compounding energy deficits in ASD brains.

"Abstract: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted tracers show increased uptake in several malignancies, indicating a potential for peptide radioligand therapy. Intra-arterial injection of radiotracers can increase the therapeutic window. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of intra-arterial injection of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and compare tracer uptake after intrahepatic arterial injection and intravenous injection. Three patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma received [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 through a hepatic arterial infusion pump, followed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Two-three days later, patients underwent PET/CT after intravenous [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 injection. All tumours showed higher uptake on the intra-arterial scan compared with the intravenous scan: the intra-arterial / intravenous standardised uptake value normalised by lean body mass ratios were 1.40, 1.46, and 1.54. Local intra-arterial PSMA injection is possible in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. Local injection increases tumour-to-normal tissue ratios, increasing the therapeutic window for theranostic applications.

"With the advancement of precision medicine, gene expression data have become a crucial tool in both cancer diagnosis and prognosis for different cancer types. The incorporation of biological pathways as prior knowledge has gained increasing interest in tackling the difficulties of high dimensionality and noisy information within gene expression data. However, most existing approaches guided by biological pathways ignore the intrinsic link between diagnostic and prognostic tasks in cancer research. They fail to capitalize on the potential of leveraging shared biological information from both tasks to enhance gene pathway representations. To this end, we introduce the Biological Knowledge-guided Multi-task Attention Network (BioMTAN), a novel multi-task learning framework designed for simultaneous prediction of molecular subtypes and survival risk. Specifically, we compile tailored knowledge collections that comprise multiple pathways for the two tasks, model them as unique subgraphs and use a multi-level information fusion strategy to provide a wealth of biological insights.",BioMTAN: A Biological Knowledge-guided Multi-task Attention Network for Co-enhanced Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis,precision medicine,Article,,advancement precision medicine gene expression data become crucial tool cancer diagnosis prognosis different cancer type incorporation biological pathway prior knowledge gained increasing interest tackling difficulty high dimensionality noisy information within gene expression data however existing approach guided biological pathway ignore intrinsic link diagnostic prognostic task cancer research fail capitalize potential leveraging shared biological information task enhance gene pathway representation end introduce biological knowledge guided multi task attention network biomtan novel multi task learning framework designed simultaneous prediction molecular subtypes survival risk specifically compile tailored knowledge collection comprise multiple pathway two task model unique subgraphs use multi level information fusion strategy provide wealth biological insight
"Parkinson’s disease is a complex, progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. While symptomatic treatments such as levodopa and monoamine oxidase-B inhibitors offer short-term relief, they do not halt disease progression. In recent years, significant advances have been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson’s disease, including alpha-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and lysosomal impairment. These insights have spurred the development of targeted therapeutic strategies aimed at modifying disease progression.

"Neoplastic diseases remain one of the paramount challenges in contemporary medicine, as their intrinsic heterogeneity and adaptive plasticity significantly hinder long-term therapeutic success. While the development of novel pharmacological agents targeting specific molecular drivers has advanced the therapeutic landscape, monotherapy approaches often fail to achieve durable disease control due to the emergence of resistance-conferring mutations. This necessitates an in-depth investigation of tumor heterogeneity and its dynamic response to therapeutic pressures through next-generation sequencing (NGS), which enable longitudinal monitoring of disease evolution. Concurrently, the paradigm shift toward combination therapies has demonstrated superior clinical efficacy compared to single-agent treatments, leveraging synergistic mechanisms to overcome resistance.

"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) represents a cornerstone of China's medical heritage, embodying millennia of clinical practice and accumulated therapeutic wisdom. As efforts to modernize TCM intensify, the demand for accurate, timely, and professionally informed responses to TCM-related inquiries has increased among clinicians, researchers, and the public. However, conventional TCM question-answering systems remain constrained by outdated knowledge bases, ambiguous interpretation of domain-specific terminology, and limited capacity for complex semantic reasoning. These shortcomings often result in imprecise or contextually inadequate answers. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a question-answering framework based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), designed specifically for TCM applications.

"Colorectal cancer remains one of the most common and deadly malignancies globally, with high mortality rates, particularly in advanced stages. Conventional therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, though beneficial, often suffer from drawbacks including systemic toxicity, multidrug resistance, and poor tumor selectivity. Recent progress in nanotechnology has introduced innovative theranostic strategies that integrate diagnosis and treatment using nanoparticle-based platforms. These nanocarriers can be tailored for both passive and active tumor targeting, as well as stimuli-responsive drug release (e.g., pH, redox, and enzymatic triggers), and provide real-time imaging guidance. Novel approaches, such as the use of Fe₃O₄-based photothermal nanoparticles to induce ferroptosis and immunogenic cell death, or polyphenol-loaded nanoparticles to enhance biocompatibility and therapeutic efficacy, have demonstrated significant potential in colorectal cancer models.

"Parkinson’s disease (PD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, exhibits an exceedingly intricate pathological process characterized by multifaceted neuronal loss, inflammatory responses, protein misfolding, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. In the pathogenesis of PD, the BBB serves not only as a protective interface for the central nervous system but also actively contributes to the regulation of neural microenvironment homeostasis. Consequently, its impaired functionality can markedly exacerbate disease progression. Within the in vivo microenvironment, factors such as chemical gradients, fluid shear stress, and physical-mechanical signals play pivotal roles in modulating cellular behavior and organ function. The spatiotemporal dynamics of these gradients critically influence BBB integrity and neuroinflammatory responses. However, traditional in vitro models struggle to faithfully replicate such multidimensional dynamic microenvironmental changes. Recently, microfluidic chip technology has emerged as a transformative platform capable of simulating in vivo conditions through precise control of microenvironmental spatiotemporal gradients.

"In precision medicine, multiomics data integration provides a comprehensive understanding of biological processes, making it essential for accurate disease diagnosis and biomarker identification. However, most existing approaches rely on graph neural networks to combine and propagate information, often integrating additional models to create multi-modal representations of patients. While effective in capturing common associations between individuals, these graph-based methods often overlook critical differences among disease subtypes. To address this limitation, we propose a novel end-to-end interpretable method for multiomics integration, designed to enhance cancer subtype prediction. Our approach employs a Multi-Modal Hierarchical Attention (MMHA) mechanism to handle the complexity of multi-source data with varying scales and structures. Unlike graph-based methods, our model uses the adaptive weighting capabilities of hierarchical attention to aggregate features from different data modalities, uncovering relationships and complementarities without the need for predefined graph structures.

"Introduction: The increasing availability of real-world clinical compliance data provides unprecedented opportunities to model medication behaviors dynamically and personalize treatment strategies. However, the complex, heterogeneous, and often incomplete nature of these data presents significant modeling challenges, particularly for capturing medication nonadherence, patient-specific therapeutic dynamics, and drug interaction effects. Existing approaches, including statistical regression models and rule-based decision systems, often fail to capture the high-dimensional, temporally-evolving, and probabilistic characteristics inherent in medication trajectories, limiting their effectiveness in precision medicine and policy simulation contexts.

"Direct detection of biomolecules using terahertz (THz) waves remains challenging due to their inherently weak signal responses. While metasurface-enhanced interactions offer a common solution, achieving scalable, nondestructive, and controllable molecular capture remains a key challenge. To address this challenge, we designed two complementary nanoprobes, AuNPs and Au@Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>, for incorporation into a THz metasurface-based sensing platform. AuNPs efficiently enrich target molecules in high-field resonance regions for signal amplification. Au@Fe<inf>3</inf>O<inf>4</inf>probes enable magnetic targeting and spatial localization under an external field. Using neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a key neuroendocrine biomarker, as the target analyte, our platform demonstrated strong linear detection from 0.01 to 50 ng/mL.

"Genomic medicine relies on precise phenotyping and global data sharing, particularly in the context of rare diseases. However, exchanging medical reports across language barriers remains a major challenge. Manual annotation with the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is also prone to inconsistency and incompleteness, risking the loss of clinically relevant information and potential misdiagnoses. We present ClinFly, an open-source pipeline that automatically de-identifies, translates, and summarizes medical reports into HPO terms, in compliance with health-data privacy standards and FAIR principles. In a multicenter, prospective evaluation, we benchmarked ClinFly against physician annotation for de-identification and phenotypic summarization of 50 non-English medical reports. The method achieved a recall of 99% and precision of 77% for protected health information (PHI) de-identification. For HPO summarization, high-confidence predictions reached a recall of 49% and precision of 92%, improving to 78% recall when including low-confidence terms, with an average of 6.6 HPO terms captured per report.

"Background: Atherosclerosis, a progressive inflammatory disease and the leading cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD), remains a global health burden due to the lack of effective early therapeutic interventions. Although growing evidence highlights the involvement of plasma proteins in atherogenesis, their causal contributions to disease pathogenesis are poorly understood. Method: To address this gap, we conducted a proteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using cis-pQTLs (cis-protein quantitative trait loci) from the deCODE and UKB-PPP cohorts (~90,000 individuals) as instrumental variables. We integrated colocalization analysis, summary-data-based MR (SMR), and HEIDI tests to systematically prioritize causal plasma proteins. Key findings were replicated in the CARDIOGRAMplusC4D (coronary artery disease, CAD) and FinnGen (CVD) cohorts. Functional validation was performed through phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), single-cell transcriptomics, histological staining, and ELISA assays to characterize protein expression patterns in specific cell types and tissues. Results: Among 2,711 plasma proteins analyzed, 28 showed strong genetic associations with atherosclerosis.

"BACKGROUND Liver metastases are very common in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). When surgical resection is possible, it is typically associated with survival benefits in patients with pNET and liver metastases. Patient-derived organoids are a powerful preclinical platform that show great potential for predicting treatment response, and they have been increasingly applied in precision medicine and cancer research. CASE SUMMARY A 51-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with the chief complaint of intermittent dull pain in the upper abdomen for over 3 years. Computerized tomography showed multiple space-occupying lesions in the liver and a neoplasm in the pancreatic body. Pathological results suggested a grade 3 pancreas-derived hepatic neuroendocrine tumor. In combination with relevant examinations, the patient was diagnosed with pNET with liver metastases (grade 3). Transarterial chemoembolization was initially performed with oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, after which the chemotherapy regimen was switched to liposomal irinotecan and cisplatin for a subsequent perfusion,",Patient-derived organoids for the personalized treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with liver metastases: A case report,precision medicine,Article,,background liver metastasis common pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor pnets surgical resection possible typically associated survival benefit patient pnet liver metastasis patient derived organoids powerful preclinical platform show great potential predicting treatment response increasingly applied precision medicine cancer research case summary year old man admitted hospital chief complaint intermittent dull pain upper abdomen year computerized tomography showed multiple space occupying lesion liver neoplasm pancreatic body pathological result suggested grade pancreas derived hepatic neuroendocrine tumor combination relevant examination patient diagnosed pnet liver metastasis grade transarterial chemoembolization initially performed oxaliplatin fluorouracil chemotherapy regimen switched liposomal irinotecan cisplatin subsequent perfusion
"Tumor organoid-based drug sensitivity prediction is a new approach for precision medicine, which has wide applications in cancer treatment and attracts increasing attention. In the field of breast cancer, conventional organoid culture methods often require more than three weeks of culture period. The culture time greatly limits the further extension of the application scenarios of breast cancer organoids. We developed a fluid system that builds on the conventional organoid “dome” culture method, which continuously and stably supplies the nutrients for the growth of breast cancer organoids. We demonstrated that this is an effective optimization method, which can shorten the culture period of breast cancer organoids without significant changes in histological characteristics and drug sensitivity features. © The Author(s) 2025.

"Tumor is the main lethal type of major diseases that human beings are facing nowadays. Traditional therapies, such as chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, etc, have been the mainstay of tumor treatment for a long time, and still have their own limitations in terms of effectiveness. In recent years, immunotherapy for tumors has attracted much attention with the rise of strategies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) relay therapy, and anti-tumor vaccines. Among them, CAR-T cell therapy, as a breakthrough tumor immunotherapy method, can precisely target tumors at the cellular and molecular levels by modifying the patient’s own T cells to express recombinant antigen receptors targeting specific tumor antigens, breaking the restriction of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the natural T cells themselves.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, remains a diagnostic challenge due to its asymptomatic early stages and the lack of reliable, non-invasive biomarkers. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are nano-sized membrane-bound particles released by cells into biological fluids and have emerged as promising carriers of disease-specific biomarkers. These vesicles reflect the physiological and pathological state of their parental cells, encapsulating proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids relevant to AD pathology, such as amyloid-β, tau, and microRNAs. Recent advances in biosensor technology have enabled the development of highly sensitive and specific platforms to detect EV-associated biomarkers. Integrating EVs with biosensing approaches—ranging from electrochemical and optical sensors to nanomaterial-based systems—represents a promising strategy for early AD diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and evaluating therapeutic efficacy. However, these technologies remain largely in preclinical or early translational stages, with further validation required in large-scale clinical cohorts.

"Cancer is a multigenic pathology whose dynamic, evolving and heterogeneous nature has led to the development of a variety of models to study it. Traditionally, two-dimensional (2D) cell culture has been used in vitro. However, an accumulated body of data demonstrates the relevance of three-dimensional (3D) cultures for modeling and studying the mechanisms involved in the initiation, progression, and resistance to treatments of tumors, particularly solid tumors. By better reproducing the spatial architecture, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumors, these 3D models help bridge the gap between in vitro studies and in vivo conditions. This review describes the main 3D culture models – spheroids, organoids, tumoroids, tumor explants and cancers-on-a-chip – highlighting their principles, advantages and limitations.

"Background/Objectives: This study presents and explores the potential of Updated Bayesian Deduction (UBD) using colorectal cancer (CRC) detection and prioritisation as a case example. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and its prognosis strongly depends on early detection and timely treatment. In Chile, colonoscopy waiting lists for symptomatic patients in public hospitals can exceed one year, limiting access to early diagnosis and reducing survival rates. Traditional single-test screening strategies, such as a single faecal immunochemical test (FIT), often yield uncertain results, contributing to inefficiencies in resource allocation. Methods: We propose a deductive approach that integrates evidence from multiple sequential and independent FITs to dynamically update the posterior probability of CRC.

"In recent years, predicting medicine demand in real-time has become a critical challenge for hospitals and pharmacies, especially with unpredictable surges due to public health emergencies, seasonal diseases, and supply chain disruptions. Traditional forecasting models struggle to manage non-linear and dynamic patterns in pharmaceutical consumption, often leading to overstocking or critical shortages. These challenges are exacerbated by the lack of integration between temporal data trends and real-world influencing factors such as public holidays, climate, and population density. To address these limitations, this work proposes an intelligent medicine demand prediction system using a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning architecture. CNN layers are employed to extract robust local temporal features from historical sales and inventory datasets, while LSTM layers capture long-term dependencies and sequence trends.

"Understanding and treating inflammation has proven a formidable challenge. The initiator and central motor of inflammation, the protein NLRP3, is an innate immune sentinel and nonspecific sensor of cellular perturbation. A wide array of inflammatory triggers prompts the formation of an NLRP3 ‘inflammasome’ complex, leading to inflammatory interleukin-1 family cytokine release and pyroptotic cell death. Since gain-of-function mutations in NLRP3 were demonstrated to cause a rare autoinflammatory disease termed cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, NLRP3 has emerged as key mediator of inflammation in mouse models for many common diseases, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and gout. But even though small-molecule NLRP3 modulators have entered clinical development, many aspects of NLRP3 activation and regulation in humans remain relatively unclear. This Review summarizes the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive NLRP3 inflammasome activation and regulation, and discusses emerging targeting strategies. Understanding these processes can guide precision medicine approaches aimed at mitigating NLRP3-driven pathologies.",The expanding role of the NLRP3 inflammasome from periodic fevers to therapeutic targets,precision medicine,Review,,understanding treating inflammation proven formidable challenge initiator central motor inflammation protein nlrp innate immune sentinel nonspecific sensor cellular perturbation wide array inflammatory trigger prompt formation nlrp inflammasome complex leading inflammatory interleukin family cytokine release pyroptotic cell death since gain function mutation nlrp demonstrated cause rare autoinflammatory disease termed cryopyrin associated periodic syndrome nlrp emerged key mediator inflammation mouse model many common disease including atherosclerosis alzheimer disease gout even though small molecule nlrp modulators entered clinical development many aspect nlrp activation regulation human remain relatively unclear review summarizes current understanding molecular mechanism drive nlrp inflammasome activation regulation discusses emerging targeting strategy understanding process guide precision medicine approach aimed mitigating nlrp driven pathology

"The substrate-specific bond cleavage capability of hydrolases provides a unique strategy for engineering off-on switches. This prompted our hypothesis that confining hydrolases and substrates to distinct biomolecular hierarchies (e.g., a protein and its modifying glycans) could enable transmission of spatial proximity information through localized hydrolysis. Using New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase 1 (NDM-1), we developed a localized hydrolysis-based proximity reporting (LHPR) platform for in situ elucidation of the hierarchical architecture of glycoproteins. We constructed protein probes by conjugating target-recognizing molecules with NDM-1, and designed click chemistry-reactive, substrate-caged fluorescent molecules as glycan probes.

"A spectrophotometric approach that is straightforward, efficient, highly sensitive, and precise has been devised for quantifying biotin (BTN) in both its pure state and pharmaceutical samples. Therapeutic assessment and patient bioavailability require biotin analysis in biological and pharmacological samples. Some drug detection methods require sophisticated equipment that many quality control laboratories and universities in developing nations lack. The methodology relies on the inhibitory approach of BTN on the Pd(II) promoted ligand substitution (LS) reaction involving 2,2′ bipyridine (BiPy) and hexacyanoferrate(II). The process entails replacing cyanide in [Fe(CN)<inf>6</inf>]4– with BiPy in ammonium dodecyl sulfate (ADS) micellar medium, triggering the development of a complex [Fe(CN)<inf>4</inf> BiPy]2-. The complex demonstrates a significant level of absorption at a specific wavelength of 440 nm. The established limit of detection for BTN is 0.089 μg mL−1.

"Prostate cancer poses a significant public health challenge worldwide, and its hereditary forms are increasingly recognized in clinical practice. Pathogenic variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes contribute to the risk of hereditary prostate cancer, but data from North African populations are still limited. This study examined germline variants in the BRCA1/2 genes in 30 Moroccan patients diagnosed with prostate cancer. Next-generation sequencing was used to analyze the full coding regions and intron-exon boundaries of both genes. Two deleterious frameshift insertions were identified: BRCA1 c.3514_3515insT and BRCA2 c.4240_4241insA, each detected in two unrelated patients. These gene carriers had high-risk disease (tumor stage ≥ 2 and Gleason score ≥ 7). A BRCA2 variant of uncertain significance (c.681 + 56C > T) was present in almost half of the cohort, alongside several intronic variants and benign polymorphisms.

"The microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA) is an intricate bidirectional communication network that links intestinal microbiota with the central nervous system (CNS) through immune, neural, endocrine, and metabolic pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of the MGBA plays pivotal roles in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. This review outlines the key molecular mechanisms by which gut microbes modulate neuroinflammation, blood–brain barrier integrity, protein misfolding, and neuronal homeostasis. We discuss how microbial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids, tryptophan derivatives, and bile acids, interact with host to influence CNS functions. Disease-specific features are described across Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, emphasizing the distinct and overlapping pathways through which gut dysbiosis may contribute to pathogenesis.

"Although it is well-established that child abuse precedes and predicts poorer executive functioning (EF), the potential mechanisms are not well understood. We thus used counterfactual mediation analysis to test how perceived control (lower personal mastery or higher perceived uncontrollability) mediated maternal or paternal child abuse, predicting lower future EF scores. Community adults from two separate samples (N = 3,291 and 2,550 in Samples 1 and 2) completed a retrospective parental child abuse self-report at Time 1 (T1), a trait-level perceived control self-report at T2, and performance EF tests at T3. Time intervals spanned approximately 6 months and 9 years in Samples 1 and 2. Stronger T1 maternal and paternal child abuse consistently predicted higher T2 uncontrollability (Cohen’s d = 0.232–1.175), which then predicted lower T3 EF scores (d =−0.411 to−0.244).

"Acanthamoeba keratitis is a rare, vision-threatening corneal infection that remains difficult to diagnose and treat, with therapy often extending for many months. Despite recent advances, the management of Acanthamoeba keratitis still depends largely on empirical regimens combining biguanides, diamidines, and azoles. Outcomes vary widely, reflecting differences in pathogen virulence, drug penetration, host response, and timing of diagnosis. It is proposed that digital-twin technology offers a powerful new framework for studying and managing this disease. Digital twin is a data-driven computational approach that creates continuously updating virtual replicas of biological systems. By integrating multimodal clinical, imaging, and molecular data, digital twins could simulate corneal infection dynamics, drug diffusion, and cyst reactivation, providing clinicians with predictive insight rather than retrospective interpretation.

"Objectives: This study presents a fully automated digital workflow using artificial intelligence (AI) to create patient-specific cutting guides for mandible-angle osteotomies in facial feminization surgery (FFS). The goal is to achieve predictable, accurate, and safe results with minimal user input, addressing the time and effort required for conventional guide creation. Materials and methods: Three-dimensional CT images of 30 male patients were used to develop and validate a workflow that automates two key processes: (1) segmentation of the mandible using a convolutional neural network (3D U-Net architecture) and (2) virtual design of osteotomy-specific cutting guides. Segmentation accuracy was assessed through comparison with expert manual segmentations using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean surface distance (MSD). The precision of the cutting guides was evaluated based on osteotomy line accuracy and fit. Workflow efficiency was measured by comparing the time required for automated versus manual planning by expert and novice users.

"Background: Circulating proteins are routinely quantified from liquid biopsies to deduce health and disease. Among these are endocrine protein hormones, which regulate human growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. Most commonly, these proteins are analyzed in plasma or serum prepared from venous blood draws. Recently, devices for quantitative capillary sampling from a finger prick have emerged, but their utility for clinical testing remains to be explored. Methods: To study the analytical capabilities of quantitative dried blood spots (qDBS), we quantified the luteinizing hormone subunit beta (LHB), follicle-stimulating hormone subunit beta (FSHB), thyroid-stimulating hormone subunit beta (TSHB), prolactin (PRL), and growth hormone 1 (GH1) by multiplexed immunoassays. We determined the performance of the endocrine hormone assays in paired qDBS and EDTA plasma samples from 100 donors (90% females) aged 4 to 78. Lastly, we compared the protein levels with those from an accredited clinical chemistry laboratory.

"Background: The term ‘remote diagnosis’ in telemedicine describes the procedure wherein medical practitioners diagnose patients remotely by using telecommunications technology. With this method, patients can obtain medical care without having to physically visit a hospital, which can be helpful for people who live in distant places or have restricted mobility. When people in the past had health issues, they were usually sent to the hospital, where they received clinical examinations, diagnoses, and treatment at the facility. Thus, hospitals were overcrowded because of the increase in the number of patients or in the death of some very ill patients given that the completion of medical operations required a significant amount of time. Objective: This research aims to provide a literature review study and an in-depth analysis to (1) investigate the procedure and roles of remote diagnosis in telemedicine; (2) review the technical tools and technologies used in remote diagnosis; (3) review","A systematic review on the roles of remote diagnosis in telemedicine system: Coherent taxonomy, insights, recommendations, and open research directions for intelligent healthcare solutions",telemedicine,Article,,background term remote diagnosis [Cluster] describes procedure wherein medical practitioner diagnose patient remotely using telecommunication technology method patient obtain medical care without physically visit hospital helpful people live distant place restricted mobility people past health issue usually sent hospital received clinical examination diagnosis treatment facility thus hospital overcrowded increase number patient death ill patient given completion medical operation required significant amount time objective research aim provide literature review study depth analysis investigate procedure role remote diagnosis [Cluster] review technical tool technology used remote diagnosis review

"The abrupt shift from face-to-face general practitioner (GP) consultations to remote ones was one of the most radical changes to the UK National Health Service (NHS) since it was set up in 1948. Overnight, people were blocked from turning up at their GP’s surgery and instead offered telephone, video or email contacts. This chapter considers how the lay press interpreted and conveyed this shift. We systematically collected UK newspaper stories about remote general practice from early 2020, mid 2020 and late 2021, and analysed these for their narrative content and form. The three time periods represented three distinct ‘eras’. Early in the pandemic, newspapers depicted remote consultations positively as an essential component of the country’s war against the virus (‘technology as superhero’).

"BACKGROUND Early transfer to specialized centers improves trauma and burn outcomes; however, overtriage can result in unnecessary burdens to patients, providers, and health systems. Our institution developed novel burn triage pathways in 2016 to improve resource allocation. We evaluated the implementation of these pathways, analyzing trends in adoption, resource optimization, and pathway reliability after implementation. METHODS Triage pathways consist of transfer nurses (RNs) triaging calls based on review of burn images and clinical history: green pathway for direct outpatient referral, blue pathway for discussion with the on-call provider, red pathway for confirmation of transfer as requested by referring provider, and black pathway for the rapid transfer of severe burns. We used the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework to evaluate implementation. These pathways affected all acute burn referrals to our center from January 2017 to December 2019 (reach).

"Advances in technology and social demands have fueled digital health use in the end-stage kidney disease population. Prior to COVID-19, there was limited use of telemedicine because of regulatory restricting the patient's home and dialysis units as originating sites. With the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency waivers a surge in digital health occurred. Federal regulations endorsed telemedicine for patients receiving home dialysis in 2019. The role of digital health, some current examples of digital health implementation, challenges and future directions are discussed in this chapter. Limited data are available regarding patient experiences and outcomes with using digital health, but more robust clinical trials are needed to explore patient and clinician experiences, patient outcomes, and cost saving. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

"Introduction Paediatric concussion is a common injury. Approximately 30% of youth with concussion will experience persisting postconcussion symptoms (PPCS) extending at least 1 month following injury. Recently, studies have shown the benefit of early, active, targeted therapeutic strategies. However, these are primarily prescribed from the specialty setting. Early access to concussion specialty care has been shown to improve recovery times for those at risk for persisting symptoms, but there are disparities in which youth are able to access such care. Mobile health (mHealth) technology has the potential to improve access to concussion specialists. This trial will evaluate the feasibility of a mHealth remote patient monitoring (RPM)-based care handoff model to facilitate access to specialty care, and the effectiveness of the handoff model in reducing the incidence of PPCS.

"The profound heterogeneity of cancer pain renders conventional “one-size-fits-all” analgesic strategies ineffective, creating an urgent need for tools that can accurately subtype pain and predict individual therapeutic responses. This review proposes a transformative solution: a patient-specific “digital twin” for pain, powered by multimodal Artificial Intelligence (AI). This framework leverages advanced AI methodologies, including large foundation models and transformer architectures, to integrate and interpret these complex datasets. By synthesizing diverse data streams—from genomics and digital pathology to clinical text and patient-reported outcomes—the digital twin can uncover complex, non-linear patterns to simultaneously classify pain subtypes (eg, nociceptive, neuropathic, nociplastic) and predict sensitivity to specific analgesic regimens. While promising, we critically assess major translational barriers, including data scarcity, model interpretability, the need for robust prospective validation, and privacy concerns. To bridge the gap from concept to clinic, we outline a concrete research roadmap and a “Hybrid Telemedicine and On-Site Expert” implementation model.

"The diagnosis and management of hypertension have been based primarily on blood pressure (BP) measurement in the office setting. Higher out-of-office BP is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, independent of office BP. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) consists of the measurement of BP by a person outside of the office at home and is a validated approach for out-of-office BP measurement. HBPM provides valuable data for diagnosing and managing hypertension. Another validated approach, ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM), has been considered to be the reference standard of out-of-office BP measurement. However, HBPM offers potential advantages over ABPM including being a better measure of basal BP, wide availability to patients and clinicians, evidence supporting its use for better office BP control, and demonstrated efficacy when using telemonitoring along with HBPM.

"Purpose of Review: Lower extremity amputations (LEAs) are among the most severe complications of diabetes, with approximately 1.5 million procedures performed globally each year. This review explores the impact of social and structural determinants of health on amputation rates in diabetic patients, highlighting disparities driven by systemic factors. Recent Findings: Structural determinants such as healthcare policies and economic systems intersect with social factors, including access to care, racial disparities, and socioeconomic status, influencing amputation risk. Black patients with diabetes face up to a fourfold increased risk of major amputation compared to non-Hispanic white patients. Lower socioeconomic status is also strongly linked to higher amputation rates. Geographic and environmental factors, like food deserts and limited access to specialized care, further exacerbate these disparities. Emerging prevention strategies, such as telemedicine and mobile health units, demonstrate promise in improving access to care. Summary: Addressing disparities in LEAs requires comprehensive policy changes and targeted",Social and Structural Determinants of Lower Extremity Amputations in Diabetes,telemedicine,Review,,purpose review lower extremity amputation lea among severe complication diabetes approximately million procedure performed globally year review explores impact social structural determinant health amputation rate diabetic patient highlighting disparity driven systemic factor recent finding structural determinant healthcare policy economic system intersect social factor including access care racial disparity socioeconomic status influencing amputation risk black patient diabetes face fourfold increased risk major amputation compared non hispanic white patient lower socioeconomic status also strongly linked higher amputation rate geographic environmental factor like food desert limited access specialized care exacerbate disparity emerging prevention strategy [Cluster] mobile health unit demonstrate promise improving access care summary addressing disparity lea requires comprehensive policy change targeted

"The digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standard leads global efforts to advance medical imaging. With the growing interest in this field, especially given the rapid developments in telemedicine applications, achieving efficient compression without losing diagnostic accuracy is critical. Therefore, there is an imperative need to employ an advanced hybrid deep-learning model, specifically designed for these medical images, to outperform current methods. The proposed method tests the development of a non-autoregressive model for parallel pixel prediction, avoiding sequential processing. This scheme uses dilated residual blocks (DRBs) to capture long-range dependencies using fewer blocks. It combines depthwise separable convolution (DSC) layers with the pixel attention mechanism to reduce computational complexity while preserving the diagnostic details in the reconstruction task. The method also leverages a discretized mean and scale Gaussian distribution mixture model to achieve efficiency across various DICOM image types. The results demonstrate that the method achieves higher compression ratios,",LEARNED DICOM IMAGE COMPRESSION VIA SUPER-RESOLUTION WITH DILATED RESIDUAL BLOCKS AND PIXEL ATTENTION,telemedicine,Article,,digital imaging communication medicine dicom standard lead global effort advance medical imaging growing interest field especially given rapid development [Cluster] application achieving efficient compression without losing diagnostic accuracy critical therefore imperative need employ advanced hybrid deep learning model specifically designed medical image outperform current method proposed method test development non autoregressive model parallel pixel prediction avoiding sequential processing scheme us dilated residual block drbs capture long range dependency using fewer block combine depthwise separable convolution dsc layer pixel attention mechanism reduce computational complexity preserving diagnostic detail reconstruction task method also leverage discretized mean scale gaussian distribution mixture model achieve efficiency across various dicom image type result demonstrate method achieves higher compression ratio

"Digital health innovations (DHIs) have the potential to transform access, continuity, and quality of healthcare in rural, regional, and remote (RRR) settings, yet they often fall short in practice. Barriers extend beyond infrastructure and technology to include workforce challenges and the complex realities of delivering care across diverse geographic, cultural, and social contexts. Effective DHIs must therefore be designed with local needs and systemic constraints in mind. Conventional logic models can align inputs and activities with intended outcomes, but their linear and static assumptions often fail to capture the adaptive, relational, and place-based nature of RRR health systems. This paper presents a logic model scaffold—an iterative, four-step process for planning, implementing, and evaluating DHIs in RRR settings. Informed by program theory and implementation science, the scaffold is illustrated through a case example from the Northern Australian Regional Digital Health Collaborative. The process involves understanding context and needs, aligning interventions with","Digital Health Innovation by Design: A Logic Model Scaffold for Rural, Regional, and Remote Settings",telemedicine,Article,,digital health innovation dhis potential transform access continuity quality healthcare rural regional remote rrr setting yet often fall short practice barrier extend beyond infrastructure technology include workforce challenge complex reality delivering care across diverse geographic cultural social context effective dhis must therefore designed local need systemic constraint mind conventional logic model align input activity intended outcome linear static assumption often fail capture adaptive relational place based nature rrr health system paper present logic model scaffold iterative four step process planning implementing evaluating dhis rrr setting informed program theory implementation science scaffold illustrated case example northern australian regional digital health collaborative process involves understanding context need aligning intervention
"The widespread adoption of telemedicine has led to an increased digital transmission of medical images. However, in the current complex network environment, these images, which often contain sensitive patient information, are susceptible to malicious attacks, posing a significant threat to patient privacy and information security. To address this issue, we propose a robust zero watermarking algorithm for medical images, leveraging discrete wavelet transform (DWT), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), EfficientNet, and discrete cosine transform (DCT). Firstly, the original medical image is transformed by DWT to extract the LL low-frequency sub-band, which is then fed into the EfficientNet neural network to obtain the global average pooling layer coefficients and perform DCT transform. Further, we process the low frequency of DCT to generate a 32-bit hash sequence and perform XOR operation with the chaotic encrypted watermark to produce the key for watermark embedding. Notably, watermark extraction can be robustly achieved without the original",Robust Zero Watermarking Algorithm for Medical Images Based on DWT and EfficientNet-DCT,telemedicine,Conference paper,,widespread adoption [Cluster] led increased digital transmission medical image however current complex network environment image often contain sensitive patient information susceptible malicious attack posing significant threat patient privacy information security address issue propose robust zero watermarking algorithm medical image leveraging discrete wavelet transform dwt convolutional neural network cnns efficientnet discrete cosine transform dct firstly original medical image transformed dwt extract low frequency sub band fed efficientnet neural network obtain global average pooling layer coefficient perform dct transform process low frequency dct generate bit hash sequence perform xor operation chaotic encrypted watermark produce key watermark embedding notably watermark extraction robustly achieved without original
"Glaucoma disease causes irreversible damage to the optical nerve and it has the potential to cause permanent loss of vision. Glaucoma ranks as the second most prevalent cause of permanent blindness. Traditional glaucoma diagnosis requires a highly experienced specialist, costly equipment, and a lengthy wait time. For automatic glaucoma detection, state-of-the-art glaucoma detection methods include a segmentation-based method to calculate the cup-to-disc ratio. Other methods include multi-label segmentation networks and learning-based methods and rely on hand-crafted features. Localizing the optic disc (OD) is one of the key features in retinal images for detecting retinal diseases, especially for glaucoma disease detection. The approach presented in this study is based on deep classifiers for OD segmentation and glaucoma detection. First, the optic disc detection process is based on object detection using a Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask-RCNN).

"In the fifth generation (5G) and the upcoming sixth generation (6G) millimeter wave (mmWave) networks, the recent emerging ultra-reliable low-latency (URLLC) applications such as telemedicine and self-driven vehicles require strict availability and reliability requirements. Using user multi-connectivity (i.e., connecting each user to multiple base stations (BSs) simultaneously) has emerged as an efficient solution for providing such high-availability requirements. However, this approach results in higher power consumption over the network, driven by the need to activate larger numbers of BSs. In this paper, we focus on optimizing the power consumption in 5G and beyond mmWave networks, considering four user connectivity levels: quadruple, triple, dual, and single. We propose an adaptable multi-objective integer linear program (ILP) that considers BSs switching on-off and user-multi-connectivity strategies. We compare the network power consumption, the number of switched-off BSs, and the energy efficiency of the four levels of connectivity. The numerical results show that our optimization",Power Consumption Optimization in 5G/6G mmWave Networks with User Multi-Connectivity,telemedicine,Conference paper,,fifth generation upcoming sixth generation millimeter wave mmwave network recent emerging ultra reliable low latency urllc application [Cluster] self driven vehicle require strict availability reliability requirement using user multi connectivity connecting user multiple base station bs simultaneously emerged efficient solution providing high availability requirement however approach result higher power consumption network driven need activate larger number bs paper focus optimizing power consumption beyond mmwave network considering four user connectivity level quadruple triple dual single propose adaptable multi objective integer linear program ilp considers bs switching user multi connectivity strategy compare network power consumption number switched bs energy efficiency four level connectivity numerical result show optimization

"Purpose: This study examines telemedicine as a sustainable service innovation that combines health, environmental and convenience benefits. It explores how these perceived benefits influence attitudes and intentions to use telemedicine and how trust in the provider shapes this relationship. Design/Methodology: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 400 adults who had used or planned to use telemedicine. Data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling with 5, 000 bootstraps. Findings: Perceived environmental (β = 0.318, p < 0.001), health (β = 0.267, p < 0.001) and convenience benefits (β = 0.231, p < 0.001) all positively affected attitudes toward telemedicine. Attitude, in turn, predicted behavioral intention (β = 0.412, p < 0.001). Trust in provider strengthened the link between attitude and intention (β = 0.073, p = 0.002). The model explained 69% of variance in attitude and 74% in intention (R2 = 0.69; R2 = 0.74).

"Despite large-scale adoption during COVID-19, patient perceptions on the benefits and potential risks with receiving care through digital technologies have remained largely unexplored. A quantitative content analysis of responses to a questionnaire (N = 6766) conducted at a multi-site acute trust in London (UK), was adopted to identify commonly reported benefits and concerns. Patients reported a range of promising benefits beyond immediate usage during COVID-19, including ease of access; support for disease and care management; improved timeliness of access and treatment; and better prioritisation of healthcare resources. However, in addition to known risks such as data security and inequity in access, our findings also illuminate some less studied concerns, including perceptions of compromised safety; negative impacts on patient-clinician relationships; and difficulties in interpreting health information provided through electronic health records and mHealth apps.

"Summary. Modern oncology faces the need to integrate high-level evidence, non-pharmacological interventions into care pathways. Among these, structured physical exercise is shifting from a simple “virtuous recommendation” to a treatment that concretely influences clinical outcomes. The phase III CHALLENGE trial, conducted on 889 patients with stage II-III colon cancer, demonstrated a 6.4% absolute increase in 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 0.72) and a 37% reduction in overall mortality (HR 0.63). Observational evidence further confirms benefits in breast, prostate, and lung cancers. This review summarizes the literature, analyzes barriers and implementation strategies (tele-exercise, dedicated professionals, hub-and-spoke models), and assesses psychological and economic impacts. © 2026, Il Pensiero Scientifico Editore s.r.l..

"BACKGROUND Home visits provide essential access to primary care for frail or homebound older adults. In Ontario, Canada, a 2019 policy change removed some financial incentives for physicians to conduct home visits. This was followed by the COVID-19 pandemic and rapid adoption of virtual care, potentially disrupting the provision of home visits. METHODS We conducted a population-based interrupted time series analysis of Ontario residents aged ≥65 years during the period July 2014 to June 2024. The interruptions were an incentive reform in October 2019 and the onset of COVID-19 in March 2020. The main outcome was the monthly number of primary care home visits per 10,000 older adults, standardized by age and sex. Segmented autoregressive models estimated changes in level and trend at interruption. Secondary analyses examined differences by age, rurality, dementia status, and visit type (palliative vs nonpalliative).

"In modern healthcare, telemedicine, health records, and AI-driven diagnostics depend on medical image watermarking to secure chest X-rays for pneumonia diagnosis, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity. A 2024 study found over 70 % of healthcare institutions faced medical image data breaches. Yet, current methods falter in imperceptibility, robustness against attacks, and deployment efficiency. ViTU-Net integrates cutting-edge techniques to address these multifaceted challenges in medical image security and analysis. The model's core component, the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder, efficiently captures global dependencies and spatial information, while the U-Net decoder enhances image reconstruction, with both components leveraging the Adaptive Hierarchical Spatial Attention (AHSA) module for improved spatial processing. Additionally, the patch-based LSB embedding mechanism ensures focused embedding of reversible fragile watermarks within each patch of the segmented non-diagnostic region (RONI), guided dynamically by adaptive masks derived from the attention mechanism, minimizing impact on diagnostic accuracy while maximizing precision and ensuring optimal",ViTU-net: A hybrid deep learning model with patch-based LSB approach for medical image watermarking and authentication using a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm,telemedicine,Article,,modern healthcare [Cluster] health record ai driven diagnostics depend medical image watermarking secure chest ray pneumonia diagnosis ensuring data integrity confidentiality authenticity study found healthcare institution faced medical image data breach yet current method falter imperceptibility robustness attack deployment efficiency vitu net integrates cutting edge technique address multifaceted challenge medical image security analysis model core component vision transformer vit encoder efficiently capture global dependency spatial information net decoder enhances image reconstruction component leveraging adaptive hierarchical spatial attention ahsa module improved spatial processing additionally patch based lsb embedding mechanism ensures focused embedding reversible fragile watermark within patch segmented non diagnostic region roni guided dynamically adaptive mask derived attention mechanism minimizing impact diagnostic accuracy maximizing precision ensuring optimal
"With the increasing importance of using medical images to diagnose diseases, it is crucial to protect these images during network transfers and unauthorized use of medical imaging data can have serious consequences, including threats of privacy and incorrect diagnoses that may endanger patient’s lives. As a result, we propose a novel image encryption algorithm for various medical images. Our approach is mostly based on the confusion and diffusion process. The confusion process begins with image-splitting and rearranging the image pixel positions using customized patterns, followed by 180-degree block rotations, and block-level permutations. The primary idea behind our methodology is to generate a secret key utilizing a chaotic logistic map that carefully considers the characteristics of the original image. Using this key, the diffusion process changes the pixel values, making the image unreadable without proper authorization. The proposed methodology exceeds existing approaches in terms of key sensitivity and adaptability against statistical",A Novel Image Encryption Algorithm for Various Medical Images Using Customized Patterns,telemedicine,Conference paper,,increasing importance using medical image diagnose disease crucial protect image network transfer unauthorized use medical imaging data serious consequence including threat privacy incorrect diagnosis may endanger patient life result propose novel image encryption algorithm various medical image approach mostly based confusion diffusion process confusion process begin image splitting rearranging image pixel position using customized pattern followed degree block rotation block level permutation primary idea behind methodology generate secret key utilizing chaotic logistic map carefully considers characteristic original image using key diffusion process change pixel value making image unreadable without proper authorization proposed methodology exceeds existing approach term key sensitivity adaptability statistical
"Background: Prenatal anxiety affects between 20% and 30% of pregnant people and is associated with adverse prenatal health conditions, birth outcomes, and postpartum mental health challenges. Individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups, sexual and gender minority groups, and those with low income are all at heightened risk for prenatal anxiety due to disproportionate exposure to adverse social determinants of health. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (dCBT) has been shown to reliably reduce anxiety in mostly White and middle- to higher-income samples, but its efficacy in low-income and marginalized pregnant people is understudied. Objective: We propose a randomized controlled trial of a dCBT (Daylight app, Big Health, Ltd) in a sample of low-income pregnant people oversampled for racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minority identity.

"The aim of this article is to analyse the technological and organisational learning processes and their relationship with organisational and institutional changes in Mexican public hospitals that have implemented telemedicine systems. A qualitative research strategy has been followed by implementing an exploratory multiple-case-study approach. The fieldwork was conducted from July 2012 to June 2015 in seven regional agencies of telemedicine (RATM) of Mexico. General information for each RATM has been updated to 2021. The implementation and use of systems of telemedicine in clinics and hospitals around the world have influenced the efficiency and effectiveness of health services, but the effects are not direct or automatic. Health organisations go through phases of internalisation of technology and this implies the development of a knowledge base, learning processes and organisational and institutional changes. The processes of learning-by-doing, learning-by-implementing and learning-by-using explain the patterns of organisational and technological change.

"Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease of the central nervous system that impacts millions worldwide, including individuals in Iran. It primarily affects young people, leading to biopsychosocial challenges with unpredictable symptoms. Self-management is crucial but challenging due to the lack of definitive treatment. New approaches, such as mHealth interventions, particularly gamification, aim to engage patients more effectively. Well-designed gamification may positively impact health behaviours and enhance collaborative care. However, its implementation in the field of MS in Iran is currently limited. So far, some mobile applications have been designed that do not incorporate gamification principles and only focus on one issue. These applications also fail to consider the family caregivers' understanding of the patient's condition. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of family-oriented gamification on the self-management of Iranian patients with MS.

"The adoption of digital therapeutics among older adults presents both opportunities and challenges in modern healthcare. While these technologies enhance disease management, autonomy, and quality of life, engagement remains hindered by cognitive, emotional, systemic, and sociocultural barriers. This narrative review synthesizes findings from 76 peer-reviewed studies identified through Scopus and Web of Science (2010–2024) to examine key factors influencing geriatric engagement with digital therapeutics. Findings indicate that technological illiteracy, privacy concerns, usability challenges, and mistrust in digital platforms significantly limit adoption. Additionally, cultural attitudes, generational skepticism, and infrastructural limitations exacerbate digital disparities. Conversely, personalized health benefits, caregiver and peer support, and intuitive design features serve as key motivators for adoption and sustained engagement. To enhance digital inclusion, this review highlights the need for user-centered design principles, tailored digital literacy programs, and systemic policy interventions, such as broadband expansion and privacy safeguards.

"Objective: Although teletherapy is increasingly common, very little is known about its impact on therapeutic relationships. We aimed to examine differences between therapists’ experiences of teletherapy and in-person therapy post-pandemic with regard to three variables pertinent to the therapeutic relationship: working alliance, real relationship, and therapeutic presence. Methods: In a sample of 826 practicing therapists, we examined these relationship variables, as well as potential moderators of these perceived differences including professional and patient characteristics and covid-related variables. Results: Therapists reported feeling significantly less present in teletherapy and their perceptions of the real relationship were somewhat impacted, but there were no average effects on their perceived quality of the working alliance. Perceived differences in the real relationship did not persist with clinical experience controlled. The relative reduction in therapeutic presence in teletherapy was driven by the ratings of process-oriented therapists and therapists conducting mostly individual therapy.

"Background Mobile health (mHealth) is reshaping healthcare delivery, especially in HIV management. The World Health Organization advocates for mHealth to provide healthcare workers (HCWs) with real-time data, enhancing client care. However, in Malawi’s Lighthouse Trust antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic, the nurse-led community-based ART (NCAP) program faces hurdles with data management due to lack of access to electronic medical records systems (EMRS) in the community setting. EMRS are not typically available in differentiated service delivery settings where reliable power and internet are often unavailable. We used human-centered design (HCD) processes to create a mobile EMRS prototype, the Community-based ART Retention and Suppression (CARES) app. CARES aims to simplify workflow for HCWs and improve client care. As part of prototype testing, we explore CARES’ feasibility and acceptability from the perspective of NCAP HCWs. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews among 15 NCAP HCWs.

"Pasturella multocida (P. multocida), a gram-negative bacterium, has long been a focus of interest in animal health because of its capacity to cause different infections, including hemorrhagic septicemia. Yaks, primarily found in high-altitude environments, are among the several livestock animals affected by these bacteria. Yaks are essential to the socioeconomic life of the people who depend on them since they are adapted to the cold and hypoxic conditions of highland environments. Nevertheless, these terrains exhibit a greater incidence of P. multocida despite the severe environmental complications. This predominance has been linked to the possible attenuation of the yak's immunological responses in such circumstances and the evolution of some bacterial strains to favor survival in the respiratory passages of the animals. Moreover, these particular strains threaten other cattle populations that interact with yaks, which might result in unanticipated outbreaks in areas previously thought to be low risk. Considering these findings, designing",Exploring the intricacies of Pasteurella multocida dynamics in high-altitude livestock and its consequences for bovine health: A personal exploration of the yak paradox,telemedicine,Article,,pasturella multocida multocida gram negative bacterium long focus interest animal health capacity cause different infection including hemorrhagic septicemia yak primarily found high altitude environment among several livestock animal affected bacteria yak essential socioeconomic life people depend since adapted cold hypoxic condition highland environment nevertheless terrain exhibit greater incidence multocida despite severe environmental complication predominance linked possible attenuation yak immunological response circumstance evolution bacterial strain favor survival respiratory passage animal moreover particular strain threaten cattle population interact yak might result unanticipated outbreak area previously thought low risk considering finding designing

The remote pre-anesthetic consultation is a medical act that must include the basic objectives of evaluation, preparation, information and obtaining consent. You must have the resources and time to do it. At the beginning of the consultation, the doctor and the parent(s) must be identified. Non-face-to-face preoperative consultation is especially useful in ASA I and II children evaluated for low-risk surgeries, reintervention, or diagnostic procedures. Those patients who require a physical examination, beyond that possible electronically, should make an appointment in the face-to-face consultation. The nursing staff can actively participate in this process as long as the anesthesiologist supervises the entire process, makes all decisions about the procedure and is responsible for the information given to the parents and the child, personally clarifying any doubts.

"Introduction: The number of adults with congenital heart disease has significantly increased in recent years. While telemedicine has emerged as a promising approach to improve care delivery and patient outcomes, its use for adults with congenital cardiopathies has not been extensively explored. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and clinical impact of a telemedicine programme for adults with congenital heart diseases. Methods: This was a single-center, prospective, observational study, carried out between January 2022 and January 2023. A wristwatch, a paired mobile device, and a dedicated hospital workstation were used to telemonitor 25 adult patients with moderate-to-severe congenital heart condition, in II-IV New-York Heart Association class. We assessed changes in hospital admission days and related costs, patient satisfaction, and functional parameters, including 6-min walk test distance, vital signs, and echocardiographic ejection fraction. Results: All 25 patients agreed to participate to the telemedicine program (mean age 38.35 ± 11.33 years,",Feasibility and effectiveness of telemedicine for adult patients with congenital heart disease: A one-year single-center experience-based study,telemedicine,Article,,introduction number adult congenital heart disease significantly increased recent year [Cluster] emerged promising approach improve care delivery patient outcome use adult congenital cardiopathy extensively explored study aim evaluate feasibility clinical impact [Cluster] programme adult congenital heart disease method single center prospective observational study carried january january wristwatch paired mobile device dedicated hospital workstation used telemonitor adult patient moderate severe congenital heart condition ii iv new york heart association class assessed change hospital admission day related cost patient satisfaction functional parameter including min walk test distance vital sign echocardiographic ejection fraction result patient agreed participate [Cluster] program mean age year

"Background: Digital health literacy describes an individual’s ability to use digital information and tools to improve their own health. Understanding how digital health literacy varies across populations could help improve health equity. However, the determinants of digital health literacy have been scarcely evaluated. Objective: This study aims to assess the levels of digital health literacy in 4 countries (United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Germany) and explore potential associations between digital health literacy and demographic characteristics and self-perceived health status. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was disseminated to participants from the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, and Sweden in December 2020. Digital health literacy was self-reported using the validated eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; range: 0-40); low digital health literacy has been previously defined as an eHEALS score<26. Participant characteristics collected were sex, age group, ethnicity, country, and perceived overall health status. A multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to explore associations between",Determinants of Digital Health Literacy: International Cross-Sectional Study,telemedicine,Article,,background digital health literacy describes individual ability use digital information tool improve health understanding digital health literacy varies across population could help improve health equity however determinant digital health literacy scarcely evaluated objective study aim assess level digital health literacy country united kingdom sweden italy germany explore potential association digital health literacy demographic characteristic self perceived health status method cross sectional online survey disseminated participant united kingdom italy germany sweden december digital health literacy self reported using validated ehealth literacy scale eheals range low digital health literacy previously defined eheals score participant characteristic collected sex age group ethnicity country perceived overall health status multivariable linear regression analysis performed explore association
"Purpose: Body image distress (BID) among head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors is a debilitating toxicity associated with depression, anxiety, stigma, and poor quality of life. BRIGHT (Building a Renewed ImaGe after Head & neck cancer Treatment) is a brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that reduces BID for these patients. This study examines the mechanism underlying BRIGHT. Methods: In this randomized clinical trial, HNC survivors with clinically significant BID were randomized to receive five weekly psychologist-led video tele-CBT sessions (BRIGHT) or dose-and delivery matched survivorship education (attention control [AC]). Body image coping strategies, the hypothesized mediators, were assessed using the Body Image Coping Skills Inventory (BICSI). HNC-related BID was measured with the Inventory to Measure and Assess imaGe disturbancE–Head and Neck (IMAGE-HN). Causal mediation analyses were used to estimate the mediated effects of changes in BICSI scores on changes in IMAGE-HN scores. Results: Among 44 HNC survivors with BID allocated",Mechanism underlying a brief cognitive behavioral treatment for head and neck cancer survivors with body image distress,telemedicine,Article,,purpose body image distress bid among head neck cancer hnc survivor debilitating toxicity associated depression anxiety stigma poor quality life bright building renewed image head neck cancer treatment brief cognitive behavioral therapy cbt reduces bid patient study examines mechanism underlying bright method randomized clinical trial hnc survivor clinically significant bid randomized receive five weekly psychologist led video tele cbt session bright dose delivery matched survivorship education attention control ac body image coping strategy hypothesized mediator assessed using body image coping skill inventory bicsi hnc related bid measured inventory measure assess image disturbance head neck image hn causal mediation analysis used estimate mediated effect change bicsi score change image hn score result among hnc survivor bid allocated
"The development of information and communication technology is developing very quickly, has made many new breakthroughs. One of these technological advances is in the health sector, the creation of telemedicine applications. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it is difficult for people to get access to health. Therefore, telemedicine applications are needed. Halodoc is one of the telemedicine applications that has successfully become the top health application on the Google PlayStore. The application has been used by more than ten million users throughout Indonesia and received a rating of 4.6. To be able to see ratings and satisfaction from the public, user reviews are needed. The very large number of reviews often contain errors, making them difficult to decipher.

"Background: The medical care of critically ill children requires special expertise in pediatric emergency and intensive care medicine. In Germany, this expertise is mainly available in specialized centers at maximum-care hospitals due to the small number of cases of critically ill children. Telemedical care networks, such as the Pediatric-Tele-Intensive-Care Network Saxony, offer a solution for networking these centers with regional hospitals providing basic or standard care. However, the evaluation of these networks represents a major challenge, especially because it involves a heterogeneous target group of patients with various diseases. This article reports on the evaluation design development process for such a network, under equal participation of all relevant stakeholders, and presents the resulting evaluation design. Methods: The methods used were a literature review, two workshops, and a survey of all relevant stakeholders (representatives of 17 partner clinics, 4 external experts in pediatric intensive care, and 2 patient representatives). Results: The",How to Evaluate a Regional Telemedical Care Network Focusing on Critically Ill Children?
